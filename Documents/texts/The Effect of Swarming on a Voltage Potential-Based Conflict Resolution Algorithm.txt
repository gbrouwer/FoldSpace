II. CONFLICT RESOLUTION METHODS
To observe the effect of swarming, two CR methods are
selected for comparison: a Modified Voltage Potential (MVP)
[7] method and a formation flying method using swarm
intelligence (SW) [2]. The underlying algorithms are discussed
in the following paragraphs.
A. Modified Voltage Potential
The principle of MVP is to model conflicting aircraft as
identically charged particles, that repel each other away from
their Closest Points of Approach (CPA), such that a Loss of Figure 3: The three steps of VA

would encounter multiple conflicts at the same time, each
conflict is resolved separately and the resolution vectors are
summed together, resulting in a general steering action.
B. Swarm Augmented Modified Voltage Potential
This algorithm is based on a model for coordination of
UAVs that fly in large groups [2]. The motion of UAVs in
groups has been modelled as combinations of three behaviors:
Collision Avoidance (CA), Velocity Alignment (VA) and
Flock Centering (FC).
1) Collision Avoidance
CA is performed using the MVP resolution strategy. CA is
always active: if no conflicts are detected, the resolution vector
of CA points in the target heading of the aircraft. CA therefore
Figure 1: The three steps of MVP conflict resolution always returns a resolution velocity vector.
2) Velocity Alignment
For VA, each aircraft will align its velocity vector to match
the average velocity of the surrounding aircraft. In order to do
so, the velocity vectors of all aircraft are summed together. The
resulting velocity vector is scaled to match the average speed
vector length of the swarm. This process is illustrated in Figure
3.
3) Flock Centering
In FC, the aircraft flies to the center of the swarm. The goal
of this is to reduce the size of swarms. This process also consists
of three steps. In the first step, the swarm center is found by

This part contains a description of the experiment. This is
found in four sections: the simulation platform, the construction
of traffic scenarios and the dependent and independent
experiment variables.
