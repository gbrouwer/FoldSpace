The work that is presented in this paper is part of an ongoing study on the relationship between
airspace structure and capacity. The present paper investigates the degree of structuring needed
tomaximizecapacityfordecentralizeden-routeairspace. Tothisend, fourdecentralizeden-route
airspace concepts, which vary in terms of the number of constrained degrees of freedom, were

I. Introduction
Atpresent,trafficseparationinen-routeairspaceisprimarilyperformedbyground-basedAirTrafficControllers
(ATCo), and relies on a rigid network of airways [1, 2]. The structure of this network historically depended on the
physicallocationofradionavigationbeacons,datingbacktotheearly1950s[3]. Thisairwaysystemwasdevisedto
helppilotsnavigatesafelyunderInstrumentFlightRules(IFR),usingsimplesinglechannelradios[3]. Eventhough
modernairlinershavethenecessaryequipmenttoflyarbitraryroutesaccurately,airwaynavigationisstillusedduring
busy daytime operations in most parts of the world [4]. This is because airways limit aircraft flight paths along
predefined trajectories, making it easier for the ATCo to monitor and de-conflict traffic flows [5, 6]. However, as
airwaysdonotalwaysallowforefficientairspaceusage,thiscentralizedairspacedesignhasbeenwidelyreportedto
benearingsaturationlevels[4,7,8,9].
In order to cope with the projected increases in traffic demand, a transfer of the traffic separation responsibility

--- Page 4 ---

from the ground to the cockpit has been proposed as an alternative to the current operational model. To realize the
resultingdecentralizedseparationparadigm,sometimesreferredtoas‘self-separation’,significantprogresshasbeen
made towards the development of airborne Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) algorithms [10]. However,
little effort has been devoted towards decentralized airspace design. In particular, there is no consensus in existing
literature if some form of traffic organization, or structuring, is also needed to maximize capacity for decentralized
separation; while Free Flight researchers advocate that higher densities can be achieved through a reduction of traf-
fic flow constraints [6, 11, 12], other studies argue that capacity would benefit more from a further structuring of
airspace[13,14,15]. Thesediametricallyopposedviewsindicatethattherelationshipbetweenairspacestructureand
capacityisnotwellunderstoodfordecentralization,i.e. doesmoreorlessstructuringleadtoahighercapacity? Or,
doesthedegreeofstructuringrequiredtomaximizecapacityvarywithtrafficdensity?
Toanswerthesequestions,thisstudyanalyzesthedegreeofstructuringneededtomaximizecapacityfordecentral-
izedseparationusingfast-timesimulations. Tothisend, fouren-routeairspaceconcepts, rangingfromacompletely
unstructureddirectroutingconcept,toahighlystructuredtubenetworkusing4Dtrajectories,arecomparedwithinthe
samesimulationenvironment,formultipletrafficdemandscenarios.Theeffectofstructureoncapacityissubsequently
analyzedfromtheeffectoftrafficdemandvariationsonsafety,efficiency,stability,arrivalsequencing,complexityand
noise pollution metrics. By including rogue aircraft that ignore concept dependent routing requirements in selected
simulationruns,therobustnessoftheconceptstonon-nominalconditionsisalsoanalyzedinthisstudy.
TheanalysisdescribedinthisworkisperformedwithinthecontextofahypotheticalPersonalAerialTransportation
System (PATS). This setting was adopted to provide the extreme traffic densities, up to 30,000 aircraft per 10,000
square nautical miles, needed to ‘stress-test’ and compare the four concepts in terms of capacity using a fast-time
simulationapproach.Notethattheaimofthisstudyisnottoprovideanyspecificconclusionsregardingdesignoptions
for a future PATS; the focus is only on the analysis of the airspace structure-capacity relationship for decentralized
separation.
This paper is structured as follows. Section II defines the notion of airspace structure, and describes the design
offourdecentralizedairspaceconceptsofincreasingstructure. ThisisfollowedinSectionIIIwiththesetupoftwo
separatesimulationstudiesthatareusedtocomparetheconcepts. Theresultsofthesesimulationsarepresentedand
discussedinSectionsIVandV,respectively. FinallythemainconclusionsaresummarizedinSectionVI.
II. DesignofAirspaceConcepts
Airspace structure can be defined as a procedural mechanism for a priori separation and organization of en-
routetraffic. Anexampleofthisincurrent-dayoperationsisthehemisphericrule, whichseparateseast-boundfrom
west-boundtrafficatalternating verticalflightlevels[16]. More generally, anyapriori structuring oftrafficimplies
posingconstraintsononeormoreofthefourdegreesoffreedomthatdescribeaircraftmotion(bothspatialaswellas
temporal). Usingthisdefinitionofairspacestructure,fourdecentralizedairspaceconcepts,namedFullMix,Layers,

--- Page 5 ---

Zones and Tubes, have been designed by incrementally increasing the number of constraints applied. This section
describesandcomparestheconceptualdesignofthesefourairspaceconcepts.
A. FullMix
TheFullMixairspaceconceptcanbemostaptlydescribedas‘completelyunstructuredairspace’.Inthisconcepttraffic
issubjectedtoonlyphysicalconstraints,suchasweather,staticobstaclesandterrain. TheFullMixconceptassumes
that any structuring of traffic decreases overall system efficiency, and that safety is actually improved by dispersing
thetrafficovertheavailableairspace. Therefore,aircraftintheFullMixconceptmakeuseofdirecthorizontalroutes,
aswellasoptimumaltitudesandvelocities,tominimizefuelusageandotherrelatedtripcosts.
AsnolevelofairspacestructureisusedtoseparatepotentiallyconflictingtrajectoriesinFullMix,safeseparation
between aircraft is entirely dependent on airborne self-separation automation, see Section III.A.3. Since Full Mix
imposesnoconstraintsonthepathofaircraft,combinedheading,speedandaltitudeconflictresolutionmaneuversare
usedtoreducedeviationsfromtheoptimalroute.
B. Layers
TheLayersconceptcanbeseenasanextensiontothehemisphericrule[16].Inthisconcept,theairspaceissegmented
into vertically stacked bands, with each altitude layer limiting horizontal travel to within an allowed heading range.
ThissegmentationofairspaceisexpectedtoimprovesafetywhencomparedtotheFullMixconcept,byreducingthe
probabilityofconflictswithcrossingtrafficforcruisingaircraft. However,thisincreasedsafetycomesatthepriceof
efficiency;whiledirecthorizontalroutesarestillpossible,verticalflightprofilesaredictatedbythebearingbetween
originanddestination,andthecorrespondingaltitudebandwiththerequiredheadingrange. Asaresult,flightsmay
notbeabletocruiseattheiroptimumflightlevels,increasingfuelburnwhencomparedtoFullMix. Anexceptionto
theheading-altituderuleismadeforclimbinganddescendingaircraft;theseaircraftareallowedtomaintainheading

headingstowithinapredefinedrange.

whileclimbingordescendingtotheirdestinationaltitude.
Figure 1 displays a schematic of the Layers concept. Here it can be seen that each altitude layer corresponds to
aheadingrangeof45o andhasaheightof300ft. Withthesedimensions, twocompletesetsoflayersfitwithinthe
airspacevolumeusedtocompareconcepts,seeSectionIII.B.1. Asaresult,shortflightscanstayatlowaltitudeswhile
longerflightscanimprovefuelburnbyflyingathigherflightlevels. Thisisexpectedtomitigatetheefficiencydropof
predeterminedaltitudesinthisconcept.
The Layers concept also makes use of the same self-separation automation utilized by Full Mix, albeit with re-
strictionsontheallowedresolutionmaneuvers. Whilecombinedheading,speedandaltituderesolutionsarepermitted
forclimbinganddescendingtraffic,forcruisingaircraft,altituderesolutionswouldcreatenewconflictswithtrafficin
adjacentlayers. Resolutionsarethereforelimitedtocombinedheadingandspeedmaneuversforcruisingaircraft.
C. Zones
SimilartoLayers,theZonesconceptseparatestrafficbasedonsimilarityoftraveldirection. However,inthiscase,a
horizontalsegmentationofairspaceisusedtoseparatetrafficalongpre-definedtrajectories. Inthisrespect,theZones
concept resembles the airway-based airspace design used today in that it facilitates travel towards and away from
locationswithhightrafficdemand.
ThehorizontaltopologyusedbytheZonesconcept,seeinFigure2,consistsoftwomajorzonetypes: radialand
ringzones. Radialzonesseparateinboundandoutboundtrafficfromthecenterofthetopology,whichcoincideswith
anareawithhightrafficdemand. Concentricringzones,ontheotherhand,functionasconnectionsbetweentheradial

D. Tubes
Asamaximumstructuringofairspace,thefinalconceptimplementsfour-dimensionaltubesthatprovideafixedroute
structure in the air. Here, the aim is to increase the predictability of traffic flows by using preplanned conflict free
routes.
The tube topology can be thought of as a graph with nodes and edges, see Figure 3. The nodes are connection
pointsforoneormoreroutes,whiletheedgesarethetubesconnectingtwonodes. Tubesatthesamehorizontallevel
neverintersect,exceptatthenodes,andaredimensionedtofitexactlyoneaircraftintheverticalandhorizontalplane.

sametime,longerflightsbenefitfromlengthiertubesathigherlayers. Finally,itshouldbenotedthataircraftareonly
allowedtoclimb/descendthroughonetubelayeratatime.
Unlike the other concepts, the Tubes concept uses time-based separation. This mode of separation dictates that
when an aircraft passes a node, it will ‘occupy’ that node for a prescribed time interval. Within this occupancy
interval no other aircraft is allowed to pass through that node to prevent conflicts. For each node, an interval list is
maintainedthatkeepstrackofthetimesatwhichthatnodeisexpectedtobeoccupied. Theselistsaresharedbetween
allaircraft,andupdatedwhenevernewflightsenterthenetwork. Furthermore,newflightsareonlyallowedtoselect
routes that are not predicted to conflict with existing aircraft in the network. To ensure that separation at the nodes

E. ConceptComparison

Tubesconcept, aircrafthavenodegreesoffreedom, andarerequiredtorigidlyfollowpreplannedspace-timeroutes
through a predefined topology. Between these two extremes, the Layers and Zones concepts were defined to allow
three and two degrees of freedom respectively. This choice was made such that the four concepts span the entire
rangefromunstructuredtostructuredairspace. Thus, acomparisonofthefourconceptsusingfast-timesimulations
can be used to analyze the structure-capacity relationship for decentralized airspace. The goal of these simulations
is not to arrive at precise capacity estimations for the four concepts, but rather to consider on how the degree of
structuring affects capacity. Correspondingly, the concepts are subjected to multiple traffic demand densities, and a
relativecapacityrankingisperformedbymeasuringtheeffectoftrafficdensitychangesonseveralairspacemetrics.

III. SimulationDesign
Twoseparatefast-timesimulationexperimentswereconductedtocomparethefourairspaceconceptsintermsof
capacityandrobustness. Thissectiondescribesthedesignofthesetwoexperiments.
A. SimulationDevelopment
1. SimulationPlatformandVehicleModeling
The Traffic Manager (TMX) software, developed by the National Aerospace Laboratory of the Netherlands (NLR),
was used as the simulation platform in this research. The TMX simulator is well established in the ATM research
community,andhasbeenusedinmanypreviousAirTrafficManagement(ATM)relatedsimulationstudies. Formore
informationonTMXcapabilities,thereaderisreferredto[17].
InordertosimulatePersonalAerialVehicle(PAV)dynamics,parametersofexistingpoint-massaircraftmodelsin
TMX,whicharebasedonEurocontrol’sBADAAircraftPerformanceModels(APM)[18],wereadaptedtomatchthe
performancespecificationsofseveralPAVsthatarecurrentlyunderdevelopment. Intotal, threedifferentPAVtypes
wereusedinthesimulations.
2. ConceptImplementation
ThefourconceptswereimplementedbymodifyingTMX’strajectoryplanningfunctions. TheFullMixconceptused
thedirecthorizontalrouteandthemostfuelefficientaltitude,asdeterminedbytheAPMs. Layersalsousedthedirect
horizontaltrajectory. However,altitudewasselectedbasedonthebearingtothedestinationandthematchingaltitude
from a predefined list (see Section II.B). Additionally, distance determined the choice between the upper and lower
layersets;flightswithacruisingdistancelessthan22Nmiusedthelowerlayerset.
FortheZonesconcept,theA*pathplanningalgorithmwasusedtodeterminetheshortestrouteoveritspredefined
horizontal topology, while the most fuel efficient altitude was chosen by the APMs. Tubes also employed A* to
calculatetheshortestpath, butinthiscase, itwasalsousedtoexaminewhethertheselectedroutewasconflict-free.
Here,aninstantaneousplanningapproachwasusedwherebytheoccupancyofeachnodealongaproposedroutewas
checkedat trafficdesired departure times. If any node along a proposed route was found to be occupied by another
flight,thecorrespondingroutewasdiscarded,andtheA*algorithmbacktrackedtoevaluatethenextbestsolution. If
noroutecouldbefound,apre-departuredelaywasappliedinmultiplesof10secondsuptoamaximumof30minutes.
Afterthisperiod,thetubenetworkwasconsideredtobesaturated,andthatflightwascanceled. Onceanappropriate
routewasfound,aircraftwererequiredtofollowtheirpreplannedroutesascloselyaspossible,includingarrivaltime
intervalsateachnode.
ForbothZonesandTubes,theA*algorithmusedinthisworkhadtobemodifiedfromthegenericversion. This
wasbecauseoriginsanddestinationsfortrafficwerelocatedoutsidetheairspacevolumeusedtodesigntheconcepts

--- Page 10 ---

(see Section III.B.1). Consequently, the generic A* algorithm could yield unfeasible solutions due to aircraft bank
angle limitations imposed by the APMs. To solve this problem, the A* implementation in this work differs slightly
fromtheconventionalalgorithmbyallowingalreadyvisitednodestoberecheckedifbankanglelimitswereexceeded,
i.e.,byremarking‘closednodes’as‘opennodes’. AcompletedescriptionoftheA*algorithmcanbefoundin[19].
3. Self-SeparationAutomation
The Full Mix, Layers and Zones concepts relied on airborne self-separation automation for tactical separation. It
consistedofseparateConflictDetection(CD),ConflictResolution(CR)andConflictPrevention(CP)modules. CD
wasperformedthroughlinearextrapolationofaircraftpositionsoveraprescribed‘look-ahead’time. Onceconflicts
werepredicted,theModifiedVoltagePotential(MVP)algorithmwasusedforCRinapairwisefashion,resultingin
implicit cooperative resolution strategies. Finally, the CP algorithm ensured that aircraft did not turn into conflicts,
inanefforttomitigateconflictchainreactions. Previousresearchshowedthatthisthreeprongedsystemwashighly
effectiveinsolvingmulti-aircraftconflicts.Furthermore,thissystemwasfoundtobecomputationallyefficientaseach
aircraftisonlyconcernedwithitsownseparationwithneighboringtraffic. Formoredetails,pleaseconsult[20].
Basedoninitialtestruns,alook-aheadtimeof60seconds,aswellasseparationmarginsof0.135Nmihorizontally
and150ftvertically,werefoundtobesuitablefortheAPMsusedhere.Sincethefocusofthisstudyisondecentralized
en-route airspace, self-separation was performed only within the experiment airspace block, defined to be between
1650-6500 ft (see Section III.B.1). Additionally, aircraft were assumed to have perfect knowledge of the states of
neighboringtraffictofocusexclusivelyonthestructure-capacityrelationship.
4. Wind
In real-life operations, wind uncertainties are a common source of prediction error. To take this effect into account,
windwasdeliberatelyomittedfromthesimulation’strajectoryplanningfunctionstostudytheeffectofuncertainties,
which could cause deviations from the planned trajectory, on the four airspace concepts. To this end, wind was
modeledasauniformandtime-invariantvectorfieldwithrandomdirectionandrandomspeed(12-22kts). Although
these conditions cannot be assumed by default, for a short time interval in a small observed area, and at sufficient
altitudestocleargroundobstacles,asforthecurrentstudy,thisassumptionisadequateforthepurposesofthiswork.
B. TrafficScenarios
1. TestingRegionandFlightProfiles
Tocreatehighdensitytrafficscenarios,asmallsquareregion,withanareaof1600Nmi2,wasusedfortrafficsimu-
lations. Althoughthisresearchfocusesonen-routeairspacedesign, arrivalanddepartureoperationsweresimulated
toensurethattheresultsdidnotignoretheimpactofgroundconstraints. Correspondingly,aircrafttook-offfromone

preventtake-offconflicts,aircrafthadaminimumcreationintervalof60secondsateachorigin,correspondingtothe
CDlook-aheadtime.
After take-off, aircraft climbed to the ‘experiment airspace block’, defined between 1650 ft and 6500 ft. Once
aircraft entered the experiment block, they followed concept dependent routing requirements, both horizontally and
vertically. At a predetermined distance from their destination (which depended on the cruise altitude), aircraft de-
scendedoutoftheexperimentblock. Standardizedclimb/descentprofileswereusedbelowtheexperimentblockfor
allairspaceconcepts,andwerespecifiedusingtheAPMs. Tosimplifysimulationdevelopment,runwaycapacitywas
not managed during landing. Instead, the effect of arrivals was analyzed using the ‘arrival sequencing’ metric, see
SectionIII.E.4.
Relativelylowaltitudeswereselectedfortheexperimentblocktolimitthehorizontalareaneededforsimulation.
Given the constant climb/descent profiles below the experiment block, higher altitudes would have increased the
horizontalareaneededforthesimulations.Alargerareawouldinturnincreasethetrafficvolumesneededtorealizethe

2. TrafficDemand

In addition to different demand volumes, traffic scenarios were created with different demand patterns. Here,
scenarioswithlargelyconverging,divergingand‘mixed’demandpatternswereused.Thesedifferentdemandpatterns
werecreatedbyvaryingtheratiooforiginsanddestinationsthatactedassourcesandsinks,andbyvaryingtheaircraft

3. RogueAircraft
Inaseparateexperiment,‘rogueaircraft’wereintroducedatrandomtimeintervals.Theirseparationrequirementswere
seventimeslargerhorizontally,andfourtimeslargervertically,whencomparedtonormalaircraftinthesimulation.
These aircraft flew haphazardly through the airspace with continuously varying heading and altitude. Furthermore,
rogueaircraftwerenon-cooperative. Thismeantthatnormalaircraftweresolelyresponsiblefordetectingandresolv-

Twotypesofloggingwereused. Event-drivenloggingkepttrackofthepropertiesofconflictsandintrusionsas

D. IndependentVariables
Twoseparateexperimentswereperformed: thenominalexperimentandthenon-nominalexperiment.
1. NominalExperiment
The nominal experiment focused on the impact of airspace structure on capacity under ideal conditions; although
trafficwassubjectedtoauniformwindfield(seeSectionIII.A.4),nootherdetrimentstoaircraftmotionwereincluded
inthisexperiment. Thetwoindependentvariablesofthisexperiment,andtheirlevels,are:
1. Airspaceconcept: FullMix,Layers,ZonesandTubes

--- Page 13 ---

2. Trafficdemand: Low,Medium,HighandUltra(seeTable1)
For each of the 16 experiment conditions, six repetitions were performed, consisting of two converging, two
diverging and two mixed traffic demand patterns. Additionally, the scenarios were also simulated with and without
tacticalCRtomeasureairspacestability,resultinginatotalof192nominalsimulationruns(4conceptsx4demand

E. DependentVariables
Sixcategoriesofdependentvariablesareusedtocomparetheconcepts:safety,efficiency,stability,arrivalsequencing,

1. Safety
Safety metrics focus on the ability of an airspace concept to maintain safe separation between aircraft. Separation

of minimum separation requirements, while conflicts are defined as predicted intrusions, i.e., when two (or more)

2. Efficiency
The efficiency of the concepts is analyzed using the work done metric. This metric considers the optimality of an
aircraft’s trajectory, and therefore has a strong correlation with fuel/energy consumption. For each flight, the work
done,W,iscomputedas:
∫
W = T(cid:1)ds (3)

3. Stability

of the airspace as a direct result of conflict resolution maneuvers has been measured in literature using the Domino
EffectParameter(DEP)[12,22]. TheDEPcanbevisualizedthroughtheVenndiagrampicturedinFigure6. Here,

BycomparingthenumberofR1andR3conflicts,theproportionofadditional‘destabilizing’conflictsthatwere
triggeredbyresolutionmaneuverscanbedetermined. Thus,theDEPisdefinedas[22]:

It should be noted that the Tubes concept does not use tactical conflict resolution (expect with rogue aircraft).
Hence,theDEPhasnomeaningforTubes.

ATMresearchoftenreferstoATCoworkload,theclassofintrinsic,orgeographical,complexitymetrics,whichonly
considerthetrafficpatternsgeneratedbyanairspaceconcept,ismostappropriateforthisresearch.
Twoindicatorsareusedtomeasureintrinsiccomplexity. Theproximityindicator,Pr,describesthegeographical
distribution of aircraft within a specified volume of airspace, enabling the identification of spatial zones with high
levelsofaggregation,relativetotheconsideredvolume. Ontheotherhand,theconvergenceindicator,Cv,measures
thegeometricdistributionofaircraftspeedvectorstodistinguishbetweenconverginganddivergingtrafficflows[23].
Tocomputeintrinsiccomplexity,foreachaircraftunderconsideration,aspatialweightingwindowthatiscentered

togethertheproductofthetwoabovecomplexityfactorsforallpairsofaircraftwithinthereferencewindow:

IV. Results
In this section, the results of the nominal and non-nominal experiments are presented separately. For both ex-
periments, theeffectoftheindependentvariables(airspaceconceptandtrafficdemand/numberofrogueaircraft)on
thedependentmeasuresisanalyzedusingerrorbarcharts, displayingthemeanandthe95%confidenceintervalfor
each simulation condition. As identical scenarios were performed with and without tactical CR, whenever relevant,

are the same and range from 12,000 aircraft in the Low scenario, to 22,000 aircraft in the Ultra scenario. On the
otherhand,theTubesconceptisshowntodeviatefromtheotherconceptsforalldemandconditions,eventhoughall
conceptsweresubjectedtothesamescenarios. Infact,themaximumtrafficvolumeachievedbytheTubesconceptin
theUltrascenarioislessthantheMediumdemandvolumerealizedbythethreelessstructuredconcepts, indicating
that demand could not be met by Tubes. This is because the Tubes concept used pre-departure delays and flight
cancellationswheneverconflictfreeroutescouldnotbefoundatscenariospecifieddeparturetimes. Asotherconcepts
didnothavetheabilitytodelayorcancelflights,allflightsinthedemandscenariosweresimulated.
Inadditiontototalvolume,itisalsonecessarytoconsiderthetrafficdensitiesrealizedduringthesimulation,see
Figure 7b. Here it is clear that traffic density is fairly similar for the Full Mix, Layers and Zones concepts for all
demandconditions. Conversely,theTubesconceptresultedinthehighesttrafficdensities,despitethelowernumber
of flights simulated for all demand scenarios (compare Figure 7a with Figure 7b). This paradoxical result can be
explainedbythefactthataircraftintheTubesconceptwereoftenforcedtouseindirectandlongerrouteswhenthe
shortestpathbetweenanorigin-destinationpairwascongestedi.e.,notconflictfreepriortodeparture. Thus,average
distances were much higher for Tubes (see efficiency metrics), causing aircraft to exist for longer durations in the
experimentvolume,whichinturnresultedinhigherdensitiesthantheotherconcepts.
These differences in traffic volume and density for the Tubes concept need to be taken into account when con-
sidering the other dependent variables. Although Figure 7a suggests that Tubes has a lower airspace capacity when
comparedtotheotherconcepts,itshouldbenotedthatthefiguredoesnotimplythattheotherconceptsareableto,for
instance,facilitatethehighervolumessafely. Therefore,conclusionswithrespecttocapacityalsodependontheother
dependentvariablesdiscussedbelow,andcannotbebasedpurelyontheamountoftrafficsimulated. Moreover,when-
everappropriate,thesemetricsarecomputedrelativetothenumberofflightssimulatedtoallowforafaircomparison
betweenconcepts.
2. Safety
The number of conflicts and intrusions per flight for all simulation conditions are displayed in Figures 8 and 9, re-
spectively. As expected, the number of conflicts and intrusions increased with traffic demand for all concepts, see
Figures 8a and 9a. Furthermore, the figures also show that the more structured Zones and Tubes concepts led to
significantlyhighernumbersofconflictsandintrusionscomparedtothelessstructuredFullMixandLayersconcepts.

withCRON.However,theeffectofCRonthenumberofconflictsdidnotfollowthesametrend. ForFullMixand
Zones, the number of conflicts increased with CR ON. This was expected, as resolution maneuvers increase flight

metrics.
It is also worth noting that the Tubes concept, which aimed at de-conflicting flights prior to take-off, resulted in
a very high number of conflicts and intrusions for all scenarios. This was because the trajectory planning functions
usedintheTubesconceptdidnottakeuncertainties,suchaswind,intoaccount. Theseuncertaintiescausedaircraftto
deviatefromtheirplannedflightpathsduringthesimulation,resultinginalargenumberofconflictsduetothetight
packingoftheTubestopology.AsnotacticalCRwasusedintheTubesconcept,theseconflictsalsoresultedinalarge

intrusions. Furthermore,thefigureshowsthatintrusionseverityisnotsignificantlydependentontrafficdemand. This
suggests that intrusion severity is more a function of the selected CR algorithm than airspace structure. Due to the
resolutionmaneuversinitiatedbytheMVPalgorithm,intrusionseveritywasreducedwhenCRwasenabledforFull
Mix,LayersandZones,seeFigure11b.
Figure12showstheresultsfortheIntrusionPreventionRate(IPR)metric,whichmeasurestheabilityofaconcept
to solve conflicts without causing intrusions. For Full Mix, Layers and Zones, Figure 12a shows that IPR increases
with traffic demand, while the rate of change of the metric appears to decrease with traffic demand and increasing
airspace structure. This is because the rate of increase of intrusion number with traffic demand is less than that of

conflictnumber,andthedifferencebetweentheratesofchangeofconflictsandintrusionsdecreaseswithincreasing
demandandstructure,compareFigures8aand9a.
Moreinterestingly,Figure12bshowsthatIPRisnon-zeroforallconceptswithCROFF.Theseconflicts,termed
‘falseconflicts’astheywereresolvedwithoutinterventionfromthetacticalCRalgorithm, werelikelytohavebeen
caused by the state based CD method used in this work. As this CD implementation relied on linear extrapolation
of aircraft trajectories to predict conflicts, aircraft, which were turning or climbing/descending to follow concept
dependent routing requirements, would trigger conflicts if they were momentarily in the projected paths of other
aircraft. Figure12balsoshowsthatIPRincreasedwithairspacestructureforCROFF,andisthehighestforTubes.
Thissuggeststhatincreasingtrafficstructuredoesimprovetheproportionofintrusionsthatcanbeavoidedasaresult
oftheprescribedroutingofthemorestructuredconcepts,eventhoughtheabsolutenumberofconflictsandintrusions
werefoundtoincreasewithstructureanddemand.
On the other hand, IPR was found to be very high (greater than 90%) with CR ON for the three concepts that
usedtacticalCR,seeFigure12b. AlthoughfalseconflictscanalsobeexpectedforCRON,theCPalgorithm,which
wasalsoactivatedwithtacticalCR,preventedaircraftfromturningintoconflicts,thusavoidingconflictsofthetype
mentionedfortheCROFFcase. Additionally,thesimilarityofthismetricforFullMix,LayersandZonesindicates
thattherelativeperformanceoftheMVPCRalgorithmremainsconstant. However,asindicatedabove,theabsolute

4. Stability
The stability of the airspace as result a of CR maneuvers is measured using the Domino Effect Parameter (DEP).
A negative DEP implies a net stabilizing effect of tactical CR whereby conflict chain reactions are outweighed by
thosethataresolvedwithoutpushingaircraftintosecondaryconflicts,whereasapositivevalueindicatestheopposite,
withconflictchainreactionscausingairspaceinstability. TheDEPforallconcept-scenariocombinationsispictured
in Figure 14. Note that the DEP is consistently zero for Tubes as it did not use tactical CR. For the other three
concepts,theDEPfortheLowdemandscenarioissimilarandnegative. Howeverathigherdemandlevels,theDEP
increasestopositivevaluesfortheFullMixandZonesconcepts. Thissuggeststhatthemaneuveringroomavailable

moredifficulttoavoidintrusionswithouttriggeringadditionalconflicts. ThisisparticularlytruefortheZonesconcept

As expected, no differences in SCx between CR ON and CR OFF were found for the Tubes concept, see Fig-
ure 16b. However, the overlapping error-bars for the Full Mix, Layers and Zones concepts indicate that SCx was
not significantly affected by CR maneuvers. This result can be explained by the fact that the computation of the

thatwereloggedduringthisexperiment.
Figures 20 and 21 display the number of conflicts and intrusions per flight with rouge aircraft alone, i.e., only
safety incidents between normal and rouge aircraft were counted for these two figures. Here it can be seen that
increasingthenumberofrogueaircraftalsoincreasesthenumberofconflictsandintrusionsforallconcepts. Further
analysis indicated that the nonlinear increase in the number of rogue aircraft only led to a linear increase in the
numberofconflictsandintrusionsforallconcepts,suggestingthatallconceptsaremorerobustthaninitiallyexpected.
Nonetheless, Figures 20a and 21a showthatthe safety ofthe Tubesconcept is considerablymore affectedby rouge
aircraftthanitisfortheFullMix,LayersandZonesconcepts.
As the trajectories of rogue aircraft were not known in advance, aircraft in the Tubes concept used the MVP
CR algorithm to avoid intrusions with rogue aircraft alone. Since the tube topology specifies both the horizontal
and vertical flight profiles, only speed resolution maneuvers were possible. Figures 20b and 21b shows that these

The above result may suggest that tactical CR can be used to complement the safety of the pre-planned Tubes
concept. However, closer inspection of the simulation data indicated that CR maneuvers made it more difficult for
conflict resolving (normal) aircraft to meet the specified Required Time of Arrival (RTA) at waypoints along pre-
plannedroutes. Thisinturnresultedinadditionalintrusionsbetweennormalaircraft,thatwereavoidedwhenrogue
aircraftwerenot includedinthe simulations. Infact, the resultingbreak-downofthepre-planned routescausedthe

numberofintrusionswasnotaffectedbythenumberofrogueaircraft,seeFigure22. Thereforethesimpleaddition
of tactical CR is not guaranteed to improve the robustness of the Tubes concept. To improve robustness and safety,

V. Discussion
Inthispaper,fouren-routeairspaceconceptsofincreasingstructure,namedFullMix,Layers,ZonesandTubes,
were compared using two fast-time simulation experiments that involved over eleven million flights. These simula-
tionsfocusedonthedegreeofstructuringneededtomaximizecapacityfordecentralizedseparation,andinvestigated

whethertheoptimalmodeofstructuringdependedontrafficdensity. Thesimulationsalsostudiedtherobustnessof
thedifferentstructuringmethodstonon-nominalevents. Here,capacitywasinferredfromtheeffectofmultipletraffic
demandscenariosonsafety,efficiency,stability,arrivalsequencing,structuralcomplexityandnoisepollutionmetrics,
whilerobustnesswasassessedfromtheinfluenceofincreasingnumbersofrogueaircraftonsafetymetrics.
Asindicatedpreviously,thegoalofthisworkisnottoproposeanoperationallyreadyairspacedesign,buttofocus
onhowthelevelofstructuringaffectsairspacecapacityfordecentralization. Inrelationtothisspecificgoal,andcon-
sideringtheresultsofallmetricsinunison,itcanbeconcludedthatsomelimitedstructureintheverticaldimension,
as demonstrated by the Layers concept, can be beneficial in terms of capacity. This is because traffic demand, in
additiontovaryingintime,displaysnopredominantpatternsinthehorizontaldimensionfordecentralization. There-
fore,astricthorizontalstructuringofairspacecancauseamismatchbetweentheimposedstructureandthedemand
pattern, as for the Zones and Tubes concepts. This in turn caused artificial bottlenecks at the intersection points of
theirpredefinedtopologies,reducingoverallperformance. Ontheotherhand,theverticalairspacesegmentationused
by the Layers concept dispersed traffic vertically, and grouped traffic by similarity of travel direction. This reduced
thechanceofconflictsbyloweringrelativevelocitiesbetweencruisingaircraftwhencomparedtothecompletelyun-
structuredFullMixconcept,withoutundulyaffectingefficiency,structuralcomplexityornoisepollutionmetrics,as
directhorizontalrouteswerestillpossiblewithLayers. Theseconclusionswerenotexpectedaspreviousresearchhad
focusedprimarilyoneitherfullystructuredorfullyunstructuredairspacedesigns.
For the range of densities considered in this work, the results of the nominal simulations also indicate that the
optimummethodofstructuringisindependentoftrafficdensity. Infact,theresultsshowacleardistinctionbetween
thetwolessstructuredandthetwomorestructuredconcepts;whileperformancedegradedwithincreasingdensityfor
all concepts, it did so at a much higher rate for Zones and Tubes. In particular, the safety of the Zones and Tubes
conceptsdeterioratedrapidlyforthehigherdensities,indicatingthattheairspacehadbecomesaturatedforthesetwo
highly structured concepts. When considering the fact that route planning was more computationally intensive for
ZonesandTubes,theadditionalconstraintsimposedontrafficbythesetwoconceptsdidnottranslateintobenefitsin
termsofcapacity.
The clear distinction between the two more and two less structured concepts was not, however, found for the
results of the non-nominal simulations. In that experiment, the safety of the Full Mix, Layers and Zones concepts
wasnotsignificantlyaffectedbyrogueaircraft. Thissuggeststhattacticalconflictresolution,whichwasusednatively
by these three concepts to resolve conflicts between nominal aircraft, could also effectively compensate for non-
cooperative aircraft, without adversely affecting capacity. This was not the case for the Tubes concept. Here, the
uncertaintiescausedbyrogueaircraftmadeitdifficultfornominalaircrafttoadheretotimeconstraintsatwaypoints
alongaroute.Theresultingbreakdownofthepre-plannedspace-timeroutesusedbyTubestoseparateaircraftcaused
a large number of unintended conflicts and intrusions. The performance of Tubes wasalso affected by wind for the
samereason. Whileallconceptswerenegativelyinfluencedbyuncertainties,thecurrentresultsshowthatthesafety

--- Page 29 ---

of highly structured and planned airspace concepts is particularly vulnerable to variations between the intended and
actualflighttrajectories.
Formanymetrics,theFullMixandLayersconceptsexhibitedverysimilarbehavior. Thesimilaritybetweenthese
two concepts was highlighted by their noise footprints, which were indistinguishable. The only difference between
thesetwoconceptsisthemethodofaltitudeselection;aircraftinFullMixusedthemostfuel-efficientaltitude,while
for Layers, altitude was dependent on the direction to the destination. Therefore, Full Mix was expected, and was
alsofound,tobeslightlymoreenergyefficient. However,thesimilarityinefficiencybetweenthesetwoconceptsmay
bearesultoftheshortcruisingdistancesusedinthiswork, andlongerdistancesmayfurtherincreasetheefficiency
differencesbetweenFullMixandLayers.
AlthoughtheverticalstructuringusedbyLayersreducedefficiencyrelativetotheunstructuredFullMixconcept,
itledtothehigheststabilityofallfourstructuringoptions. ThishighstabilitywasreflectedbythenegativeDomino
EffectParameter(DEP)valuesloggedforalldensitiesintheLayersconcept. AnegativeDEPindicatesareduction

negativeDEPiscausedbythealignmentofneighboringtraffic,andtheconsequentreductionofrelativevelocitiesthat
aidsCRperformance,abehaviorthatisfurtheramplifiedbythelimitedheadingrangesavailabletocruisingaircraft
in the Layers concept. Although negative DEPs were also found for Full Mix and Zones at low demand levels, at
higher densities, these modes of structuring transitioned to positive DEP vales, indicating a greater degradation of
airspace stability with density. Hence, the stability analysis indicates that the altitude constraints utilized by Layers
canaccommodateevenhigherdensitiesthanwhatwasconsideredinthiswork,withoutsignificantlyreducingsafety
orefficiency. Thisreiteratesthenotionthatalimiteddegreeofverticalstructuringcanbebeneficialforthecapacity
androbustnessofdecentralizedairspace.
Itshouldbenotedthattheresultsofthisstudyare,tosomedegree,sensitivetothespecificparametersettingsse-
lectedfortheconcepts.However,giventhemagnitudeofthedifferencesinalloftheresults,aswellastheconsistency
between results, it is unlikely that the overall trends are affected by different settings; capacity for decentralization
was found to improve when structural constraints did not affect the horizontal path of aircraft. This conclusion is
mostapplicablefortrafficscenarioswithoutanydistincthorizontalpatterns. Fortrafficdemandcaseswithdiscernible
horizontalpatterns,suchasforcurrenthub-and-spokeoperations,airspaceconceptsthatpermitflexibleroutinginthe

VI. Conclusions
Thisworkinvestigatedthedegreeofstructuringneededtomaximizecapacityfordecentralizeden-routeairspace.
Tothisend,fourdecentralizeden-routeairspaceconceptsofincreasingstructurewerecomparedusingfast-timesim-
ulations. Forthestudieddensities,thefollowingconclusionscanbedrawn:
• Capacity benefits when the horizontal path of aircraft is not over-constrained. This is because traffic demand
displaysnopredominantpatternsinthehorizontaldimension,fordecentralization.
• Capacity is maximized when vertical constraints are used to separate traffic with different travel directions at
different flight levels. This mode of structuring improved performance over completely unstructured airspace
bydecreasingrelativevelocitiesbetweenaircraftcruisingatthesamealtitude,whileallowingdirecthorizontal
routes. Thereducedrelativevelocitiesalsoincreasedthestabilityoftheairspacetotacticalconflictresolutions.
• Conversely, structuringmodesthatimposedhorizontalconstraintscausedaconvergenceoftrafficattheinter-
sectionsofstructuralelements. Thesetrafficconcentrationsreducedoverallperformanceforsuchconcepts.
• Theoptimummethodofstructuringwasfoundtobeindependentofdensity. Capacitygenerallybenefitedfrom
areductionofstructuralconstraints.
• Robustnesstouncertaintiesissignificantlyreducedwhendecentralizationusingtimebasedseparationiscom-
binedwithapredefinedandfixedthreedimensionalroutestructure.
