ABSTRACT. This study aims at making a sensorial analysis of red wines from the Șarba wine
region, Odobești Vineyard. In order to determine wines from a sensory point of view, we first
studied the influence of geomorphology on the sensory character. In the analysis of red wines
sensorial quality we used several wines from 2012 (i.e. Pinot noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Black
Fetească and Merlot), as 2012 was a beneficial year from the point of view of red grapes ripening,
and the oenoclimatic index was favourable to obtaining savoury and flavoured wines.
The vegetal flavour does not affect the wines’ harmony too much.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Șarba wine region in the Odobeşti Vineyard is situated on the foothills of the Curvature
Sub Carpathian region, that reach altitudes of 220 m. Due to the conditions of pedoclimate and soil,
which is highly acidic, the wines obtained are appreciated as fresh and fruity. The lithological
substratum is made of sands and alluvial-proluvial gravels, covered by loess deposits.
The alternance of these strata form a detritus Pleistocene complex, comprising marine pliocenic
marls, clays and sands (Chiriac, 2009).
The soil is represented by leached chernozems (cambic and clay-illuviated), dominant in the Eastern
and Central part of the wine region, and brown soils to the West. Through their medium and light
texture, these soils ensure permeability (Chiriac, 2009).
The area’s geomorphologic and hydrographic ensemble allows for the existence of a great variety of
grapevine varieties in the plantation (Gâștescu, 2010). Global solar radiation reaches annual
averages over 125 Kcal/cm², varying between 110 Northern exposures and 140 on Southern
exposures (Figure 1).

Average annual temperature is about 9-10ºC, thus a medium thermal amplitude; the most important
values were calculated in 2012 (www.meteorologia.ro).

The average annual duration of solar irradiance is about 2100 hours (Fig. 4). These high
values also justify the annual amount of temperature that are lower than or equal to 0º C, around
3800º, which ensures for optimal ripening conditions and the concentration of sugars ad aromatic
substances in grapes (Figure 3).
The oenoclimatic aptitude index is the sum of the active heat balance and the total real hours
of sunshine, from which we subtract the excess precipitations during the active life of vines. The
resulting values are higher than 4150, reaching 4214 in 2012, a value that is specific to the area
(Figure 4).

The quality of red wines depends on several factors, besides pedoclimate, i.e.: maceration
enzymes used to extract flavour precursors (Lengyel et al. 2013, Cano-Lopez et al. 2010, Bautista –
Ortin et al. 2005, Lengyel 2014), the micro-oxygenation of the fermentation process (Llaudy et al.
2006, Cano-Lopez et al. 2009), the stage of grape ripeness (De Montmollin et al. 2007, Dupraz et
al. 2008). The concentration of phenolic compounds and anthocyanins leads to determining the
primary flavour character of red wines (Lengyel 2012, Lengyel et al. 2012), but also to the
amplification of wines' fruity notes.
Materials and methods
Red wines (Pinot noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Fetească neagră and Merlot), production of 2012, from
Șarba, Odobești, selected based on the most favourable oenoclimatic parameters.
The wines were tested by a sample of 10 oenology specialists; they marked each sensory
characteristic from 1 to 10. The average marks given are visible in Figures 5, 6, 7, 8.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
The materials used in the present study consisted of four red wines from 2012 which, compared
to the other two years, was beneficial to red grape ripening and to obtaining harmonious wines.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Figures 5-8 show that Pinot noir wines show a high olfactory intensity, being marked between 4.5
in the case of Cabernet Sauvignon and 7.5 in the case of Pinot noir. The wines Black Fetească and
Merlot recorded intermediary values; the average marks were 6.5 and 5.5 respectively.
It is noted that the wines Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon is the least bitter, while the most bitter
wines are Black Fetească, with wines being marked between 1.2 and 3.2. Pinot noir recorded
average values, being marked 1.5.
The vegetal character of wines was marked between 5.3 in the case of Black Fetească and 3.3 in
the case of Cabernet Sauvignon. The wines Pinot noir and Merlot got intermediary values, with an
average of 4.3. In the case of Cabernet Sauvignon, the vegetal character is not as strong.
It is noted that the bouquet is less pronounced in the case of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. From
the point of view of the bouquet, the wines were marked between 6.2 (Black Fetească) and 8.2
(Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon). Pinot noir wines recorded intermediary values; their average
mark was 7.2.
The taste of berries is stronger in the case of Merlot wines, being marked between 4.1 (Cabernet
Sauvignon) and 8.1 (Merlot). The wines Black Fetească and Merlot recorded intermediary values;
the average marks were 6.1 and 7.1 respectively.
It is noted that the taste of bananas is stronger in the case of Pinot noir and Fetească neagră wines,
as they are marked between 2.7 (Cabernet Sauvignon) and 5.7 (Pinot noir and Black Fetească).
Merlot wines recorded intermediary values; their average mark was 4.7.
The taste of fruit is stronger in the case of Black Fetească and Merlot wines, being marked
between 7.9 (Pinot noir and Cabernet Sauvignon) and 8.9 (Fetească neagră and Merlot). Black
Fetească wines are very buttery, being marked between 7.9 (Merlot) and 9 (Fetească neagră).
Cabernet sauvignon and Pinot noir wines recorded intermediary values; the average marks were 8.1
and 8.4 respectively.
Cabernet Sauvignon wines are the most savoury; wines were marked between 5.8 (Fetească neagră)
and 7.8 (Cabernet sauvignon). Pinot noir and Merlot wines recorded intermediary values; the
average mark was 6.8.
It is noted that Cabernet Sauvignon wines are the most harmonious; wines were marked between
5.9 (Pinot noir and Black Fetească) and 7.9 (Cabernet sauvignon and Merlot).

It is noted that the taste of caramel is more pronounced in the case of Fetească neagră wines; wines
were marked between 1.4 (Pinot noir) and 4.4 (Black Fetească). Cabernet sauvignon and Merlot
recorded intermediary values; the average marks were 2.4 and 3.4 respectively.
It is noted that Black Fetească wines are highly full bodied; wines were marked between 6.1
(Merlot) and 8.1 (Black Fetească). Pinot noir and Cabernet sauvignon recorded intermediary values;
the average marks were 6.2 and 7.1 respectively.
It is noted that Merlot wines have a less leathery taste; wines were marked between 1.3 (Merlot)
and 3.4 (Black Fetească). Cabernet sauvignon and Pinot noir wines recorded intermediary values;
the average marks were 1.4 and 2.4 respectively.

4. CONCLUSIONS
Red wines of 2012 show intense olfactory notes, a full body and a bouquet specific to the variety.
The most beneficial year for red grape ripening was 2012, as the oenoclimatic index was most
beneficial to these varieties in order to obtain buttery wines, having berry, savoury and fruity
flavors.
Pedoclimatic indicators in the area resulted in harmonious wines, with notes of caramel and faint
leathery notes.
A faint vegetal flavour consistent with the geomorphological and hydrographic ensemble of the area
is always present, but it does not affect the harmonious character of wines.
