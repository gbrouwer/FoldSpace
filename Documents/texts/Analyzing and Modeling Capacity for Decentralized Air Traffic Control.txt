Summary
The current system of Air Traffic Control (ATC) relies on a centralizedcontrol ar-
chitecture. At its core, this system is heavily dependent on manual intervention
by human Air Traffic Controllers (ATCos) to ensure safe operations. The capac-
ity of this system is, therefore, closely tied to the maximum workload that can be
tolerated by ATCos. Although this system has served the needs of the air trans-
portation industry thus far, the increasing delays and congestion reported in many
areasindicatesthatthecurrentcentralizedoperationalmodelisrapidlyapproaching
saturation levels.
To cope with the expected future increases of traffic demand, many researchers
haveproposedatransitiontoadecentralizedtrafficseparationparadigminenroute
airspaces. Although there are several variants of decentralized ATC, this thesis
focuses on a variant known as self-separation. In self-separated airspace, each
individual aircraft is responsible for its own separation with all surrounding traffic.
To facilitate self-separation, significant research effort has been devoted towards
the development of new algorithms for automated airborne Conflict Detection and
Resolution (CD&R).
However, in spite of over two decades of active research highlighting its theorized
benefits, decentralization/self-separation is yet to be deployed in the field. From a
technicalpointofviewalackofunderstandingonthreeopenissuesnamelyairspace
design,airspacesafetymodeling,andairspacecapacitymodeling,haveimpededits
further development and implementation. The goal of this research is to address
these three open problems in order to bring self-separated ATC closer to reality.
Consequently, the main body of this thesis is divided into three parts, with each
part tackling one of the three aforementioned open problems.
The first part of this study focused on decentralized airspace design. Although
airspacedesignelementssuchasairwaysandsectorsareusedbythecurrentcen-
tralized ATC system, the use of similar design options to optimize decentralized
operations have not been considered in detail by previous studies. In fact, there is
noconsensusinexistingliteratureonwhetherornotsomeformoftrafficstructuring
isalsobeneficialfordecentralizedATC,withdifferentstudiesonthistopicpresent-
ing diametrically opposite conclusions. To gain a more thorough understanding of
the relationship between airspace design and capacity for decentralized ATC, this
study used fast-time simulations to empirically compare four airspace concepts of
increasing structure. The four concepts, ranging from a completely unstructured
direct routing airspace concept, to a highly structured tube network using 4-D tra-
jectories, were subjected to multiple traffic demand conditions within the same
simulation environment, for both nominal and non-nominal conditions.

viii Summary
The results of these simulations were highly unexpected; since previous studies
hadfocusedononlyfullyunstructuredandfullystructuredairspacedesigns,oneof
thesetwoextremedesignoptionswashypothesizedtoleadtothehighestcapacity.
Thesimulationresults,ontheotherhand,indicatedthatalayeredairspacedesign,
which used heading-altitude rules to vertically separate cursing aircraft based on
theirtraveldirections,resultedinthebestbalanceofallairspacemetricsconsidered.
Thisapproachtoorganizingtrafficnotonlyloweredrelativevelocitiesbetweenair-
craft, it also permitted direct horizontal routes. As such the layered airspace con-
cept led to the highest safety of all designs tested, without unduly reducing route
efficiency relative to the completely unstructured design; the latter design option
resulted in the second-best capacity. In contract, airspace concepts that imposed
strict horizontal constraints on traffic caused a mismatch between the imposed
structureandthetrafficdemandpattern. Thisinturnledtoartificialtrafficconcen-
trations that reduced overall performance and capacity. To summarize, capacity
for decentralization improved when structural constraints fostered a reduction of
relative velocities, and when direct horizontal routes were permitted.
The second part of this thesis derived mathematical conflict count models that
quantified the intrinsic safety of an airspace design, using unstructured and lay-
ered airspace concepts case studies. Here, the notion of intrinsic safety refers to
the ability of an airspace design to prevent conflicts from occurring solely because
of the constraints that it imposes on traffic motion. The models considered here
are often referred to as ‘gas models’ in literature. As the name implies, this mod-
eling approach treats conflicts between aircraft similar to the collisions that occur
between ideal gas particles. Although such models are widely used within ATC re-
search, most previous gas models have focused on only conflicts between cruising
aircraft, limiting their applications.
This thesis, therefore, extends gas models such that they take into account the
effects of both cruising and climbing/descending traffic on conflict counts. The
developedmethodgroupedaircraftaccordingtoflightphase,whilealsoconsidering
the interactions, as well as the proportion of aircraft, in different flight phases.
This approach was combined with a simple, but novel, method to compute both
the horizontal and vertical components of the weighted average relative velocity
in an airspace. Fast time simulation experiments indicated that the resulting 3-
D models estimated conflict counts with high accuracy for both unstructured and
layered designs, for all tested conditions. Moreover, the results also indicated that
climbing/descendingaircraftareinvolvedinthevastmajorityofconflictsforlayered

Summary ix
this research investigated the effects of such traffic scenario assumptions on the
accuracy of analytical gas models using targeted fast-time simulations. Addition-
ally, this work also developed and tested so called numerical‘model adjustments’
that relaxed the dependency of the models on the idealized scenario assumptions.
As before, conflict count models for unstructured and layered airspaces were used
as cases studies for these purposes.
Theresultsofthesetargetedsimulationsindicatedthatnon-idealaltitudeandspa-
tialdistributionsoftraffichaddrasticnegativeeffectsonanalyticalmodelaccuracy,
while non-ideal heading distributions had a smaller negative effect on accuracy. In
contrast, ground speed distribution did not meaningfully affect conflict counts for
the airspace designs considered here; its effect, however, did increase in magni-
tudeastheheadingrangeperflightlevelwasdecreasedforlayeredairspaces. The
simulation results also indicated that the numerical model adjustments developed
inthisthesisincreasedaccuracyforthemorerealisticscenariostothelevelsfound
with the analytical model for the ideal scenario settings. Therefore, in addition
to providing a physical understanding of the factors that affect intrinsic airspace
safety, the adjusted conflict count models can also be used as tools for practical
airspace design applications.
The third and final part of this thesis developed a quantitative method to deter-
minethecapacitylimitofdecentralizedairspaceconcepts. Themethodconsidered
here,namedCapacityAssessmentMethodforDecentralizedATC(CAMDA),defined
capacityasthetrafficdensityatwhichconflictchainreactionspropagateuncontrol-
lablythroughouttheentireairspace. Inotherwords,atthecapacitylimit,allaircraft
existsinapersistentstateofconflict,becauseeveryconflictresolutionactionleads
to an infinite number of new conflicts. This critical density was identified using a
semi-empirical approach whereby analytical models describing the intrinsic safety
provided by an airspace design are combined with empirical models describing the
actionsofCD&Ralgorithms. Becauseconflictchainreactionsaffectboththesafety
andefficiencyoftravel,theapproachusedbyCAMDAtreatscapacityasanintrinsic
property of the airspace.
TheCAMDAmethodisdemonstratedhereusingfast-timesimulationsofdecentral-
ized unstructured and layered airspace designs that utilized a state-based method
for conflict detection, and a voltage potential-based algorithm for conflict resolu-
tion. ThesimulationresultsconfirmedthepredictionsoftheCAMDAmodels;capac-
ity was found to be higher for layered airspaces because it used predefined flight
levels and heading altitude rules for cruising traffic. These two design elements
reducedthenumberofpossiblecombinationsoftwoaircraft,andtheaveragecon-
flict probability between aircraft, when compared to unstructured airspaces, which
inturnincreasedthemaximumcapacityforlayeredairspaces. Thesimulationsalso
strongly indicated that the pairing between the selected airspace design and se-
lected CD&R algorithm needs to be optimized to maximize decentralized airspace
capacity.

x Summary
The simulations used to demonstrate CAMDA also studied the effects of conflict
detectionparameters,conflictresolutiondimension,conflictresolutionpriority,and
the speed distribution of aircraft, on capacity. For all studied cases, CAMDA esti-
mated the occurrence of conflict chain reactions with high accuracy, and therefore
enabledcapacityestimationsusingrelativelynon-intensivelowdensitytrafficsimu-
lations. Furthermore,becauseallCAMDAparametershaveaphysicalinterpretation,
theeffectsofalltestedconditionsoncapacitycouldbedirectlyunderstoodfromthe
structure of the underlying models. For these reasons, in addition to providing a
comparativecapacitymeasurementmetric,theCAMDAmethodcanalsobeusedto
systematically select the experimental conditions necessary to assess the capacity
limit of decentralized airspace designs.
Although the safety and capacity models derived in this work have focused on un-
structuredandlayeredairspacedesigns,itisimportanttorealizethattheunderlying
modelingmethodsareapplicabletootherairspaceconcepts. Anyadaptationsalong
these lines would require an analysis of how the constraints imposed by a partic-
ular airspace design affects the number of possible combinations of two aircraft,
andtheaverageconflictprobabilitybetweenanytwoaircraft,sincethesetwobasic
factorsarethestartingpointforallthesafetyandcapacitymodelsdiscussedhere.
Extensions of the models for other airspace designs is an interesting avenue for
further research.
Itshouldbenotedthatallthequantitativemodelsdescribedinthisthesishavebeen
validated under ideal weather conditions. Since weather is known to adversely af-
fectthesafetyandthecapacityoftheairspace,theaccuracyofthederivedmodels
for other, more realistic, weather conditions should be considered in future re-
search. In this context, it is worth recognizing that the semi-empirical CAMDA
capacity assessment method could, in theory, be used to quantify the capacity re-
ductions caused by various whether phenomena, as long as such phenomena can
be simulated with adequate realism. The use of the CAMDA method to assess the
effects operational constraints, such as weather, on capacity represents another
interesting topic for further analysis.
Lastly, it is necessary to consider the practical applications of this research. Before
the safety conscious aviation authorities can be convinced of a radical transforma-
tion of en route airspace from a centralized to a decentralized design, it is likely
that more practical experience needs to be gained with decentralized ATC. Thanks
totherapidemergenceofunmannedandpersonalaerialvehicles,itmaybepossi-
ble to obtain such empirical data in the near future. The incredible traffic volumes
forecasted for these new aircraft types, and the clean sheet approach to ATC that
is required to facilitate their operation, has provided the necessary incentives for
aviation authorities to investigate important some aspects of decentralization for
the growing field of urbanairspacedesign. Because of the generic nature of the
airspace designs and of the quantitative safety and capacity models discussed in
thisthesis,theresultsofthisworkcanbegeneralizedbeyondthespecificconditions
that have been considered here, for instance for the lower speeds of anticipated
for unmanned aircraft. Therefore, in the short term, the methods developed in

towards the design of new concepts that enable low altitude urban air transport
operations.

Introduction

ground-based air traffic controllers. Consequently, the capacity limits of the
current system of air traffic control is closely tied to the maximum workload
that an air traffic controller can tolerate. To cope with the ever increasing
demand for air travel, many researchers have proposed a transfer of traffic

1 1.1. A Brief History of Air Traffic Control
In the early days of aviation, pilots relied on simple ‘see-and-avoid’ principles to
preventmid-aircollisions,andnavigatedusinglandmarkssuchasroads,riversand
railway tracks [1]. As a result of numerous near misses and several high-profile
accidents, these simple rules for collision avoidance and navigation were deemed
to be no longer adequate as traffic demand increased in the 1920s [1].
To improve safety, and bolster public confidence in the fledgling air transportation
industry, more formal systems and procedures for Air Traffic Control (ATC) were
developedinthe1930s. Theseincluded,amongstothers,theinstallationofrotating
light beacons for navigation in low visibility conditions, which in turn led to the
establishment of the first airways/air-routes between major cities [2].
Thiseraalsosawtheintroductionofanewroleinaviation,onethathadaprofound
impact on the design and evolution of the entire current ATC system architecture.
ThiswastheroleoftheAirTrafficController(ATCo). Initially,ATCoswerestationed
only at airfields, see Figure 1.1, and their primary task was to coordinate the flow
ofaircraftinandaroundairportsfromairtrafficcontroltowers,orTWRs[3].

Bythemid-1930s,ATCoresponsibilitieswereextendedtoalsoseparatehighaltitude
aircraft in en route airspaces [2, 3]. These ATCos, located at Area Control Centers
(ACCs)1, used verbal position reports from pilots, and data from pre-filed flight
plans,toidentifyandwarnflightcrewsaboutpotentialcollisions;seeFigure1.2(a).

traffic,newregulationsforcedpilotstofollowtheinstructionscommandedbyATCos

Figure1.2: EvolutionofenrouteAreaControlCenters(ACC)[4]
AftertheSecondWorldWar,severaltechnologicalinnovationstransformedthecen-
tralized ATC system. Most notably, radar technology gave ATCos more active con-
trol of the traffic [5]; see Figure 1.2(b). Ground navigation aids were also updated
with radio beacons to further extend the network of airways to connect different
parts of the world [2]. Additionally, to improve the transition between TWRs and
ACCs, new Terminal Maneuvering Area centers (TMAs)2 were established to sep-
arate climbing and descending aircraft around airports, and also from traffic in en
route airspaces [5].
Althoughincreasinglevelsofautomationhavebeenintroducedovertheyears,from
asystem-designpointofview,today’sATChasnotchangedsubstantiallysincethe
1960s; controlled airspace is still structured into TWRs, TMAs and ACCs, and more
importantly, traffic separation is still heavily reliant on manual intervention by AT-
Cos [5]. For this reason, ATCo workload is often cited as one of the main capacity
bottlenecksofthecurrentcentralizedATCsystem[6–11]. Infact,theneedforAT-
Cos to manage their workload explains the continued dependence on airway navi-
gation during busy daytime operations. Although modern airliners can fly arbitrary
routes accurately, airways limit aircraft flight paths along predefined trajectories,
see Figure 1.3, and the resulting predictable and structured flow patterns make it
easier for ATCos to monitor and deconflict traffic. However, as the airway struc-
ture is historically dependent on the location of radio navigation beacons, airway
routingcanaddsignificantextradistancetoflights(inrelationtodirect/great-circle
routing) [12].
Duetosuchinefficiencies,thecentralizedATCsystemisnotexpectedtokeeppace
with the ever-increasing demand for air transportation [12–17]. Evidence for this
can be found by studying delay statistics. In Europe, for instance, a moderate
traffic demand increase of 2.4% in 2016 led a disproportionate 20.9% increase
of en route delays [12]. In addition to costing airlines as much as 479 million
euros, the trajectory deviations contributing to these delays also led a to a 25.3%

increase in the number of serious separation minima infringements, an indicator
of safety [12]. These bleak statistics are likely to worsen in the future given the
world-wide shortage of ATCos.
In response to the degrading performance of the current ATC system, novel ap-
proaches for ATC are being actively explored by large research projects in Europe
andintheUnitedStates,knownasSESARandNextGenrespectively[16–19]. While
these programs aim to introduce incremental capacity improvements in the short-
term, some of the proposed long-term plans call for a radical transformation of en
route airspace from a centralized to adecentralizeddesign.
1.2. What is Decentralized ATC?
To increase en route airspace capacity beyond the limitations of the current cen-
tralizedsystem,manystudieshaveproposedadecentralizationoftrafficseparation
responsibilities, from ground-based ATCos to each individual aircraft. A transition
to decentralized ATC, therefore, implies a return to the early days of flight when
pilots performed flying, navigation and collision avoidance tasks, but with the aid
of modern surveillance and automation technologies. This section describes the
conceptual design of decentralized ATC, its advantages over centralized ATC, and
provides an overview of the previous research in this field.
1.2.1. Conceptual Design of Decentralized ATC
ThechangethatdecentralizationbringstoATCcanbebestunderstoodbycompar-
ingitsconceptualdesignwiththatofthecurrentcentralizedsystem;seeFigure1.4.
As mentioned before, in centralized ATC, an ATCo on the ground is responsible
for adequate separation between all aircraft in his/her airspace sector, see Fig-
ure1.4(a). Hence,incentralizedATC,aircraftactaspassiveagentswithrespectto

ferred to the cockpit. In this case, aircraft act as activeagents, and each aircraft
is responsible for its own separation with all surrounding traffic, see Figure 1.4(b).
Consequently, this type of ATC is also referred to as ‘self-separation’.
To enable self-separation, aircraft need to be made aware of the positions of all
neighboringtraffic. Inliterature,thisisoftenachievedusingAutomaticDependent
Surveillance-Broadcast(ADS-B),asystemforinter-aircraftcommunication[21,22].
UsingADS-Btransmitters,aircraftperiodicallybroadcasttheirstateinformation,in-
cludingtheiridentification,3Dposition,velocityandtargetstate,usingdatagather
by onboard sensors. This functionality, known as ADS-B OUT, is already in use,
with many parts of the world mandating ADS-B transmitter equipage for flights
operating in controlled airspace by 2020 [23, 24].
AnalogoustoADS-BOUTisADS-BIN.AircraftwithADS-BINcapabilityusereceivers

is presented to pilots using cockpit displays in real time. Subsequently, pilots can
identify and resolve conflicts manually, or do so with the support of automated
algorithms for airborne Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R). Recent studies
have shown that the ADS-B system and its signal quality are sufficiently robust for
self-separation applications [25, 26].
1.2.2. Advantages of Decentralized ATC
Decentralized separation in en route airspace is expected to yield several advan-
tages over centralized ATC in terms of efficiency, safety and capacity.
1.2.2.1. Efficiency
Asindicatedearlier,oneofthemajorsourcesofdelayincurrentoperationshasbeen
attributed to the use of airways [12]. Although airways reduce ATCo workload by
organizingtrafficalongpredefinedroutes,seeFigure1.5(a),theycanalsoincrease
flight distances. Since ATCos are not actively involved with traffic separation in

decentralized ATC, aircraft would no longer be restricted to using airways for en
routenavigation. Instead, airspace users are free to fly arbitraryroutesby making
full use of the so called ‘Area Navigation’ (RNAV) capabilities of modern onboard
Flight Management Systems (FMS), see Figure 1.5(b). In many cases, the lack of
routing constraints will allow operators to choose direct horizontal routes, as well
as the most fuel-efficient altitudes. Since deviations from such routes are only
necessaryifconflictsareencountered, theabilitytoflydirectroutesisexpectedto
minimize fuel usage and maximize efficiency [27].
Limited use of direct routing has already shown positive results in so called ‘Free
Routing Airspaces’ (FRAs) in current European operations in areas with low traffic
densities. In 2016, direct routing in FRAs yielded an average route efficiency in-
crease of 1.6% per flight, with gains of up to 4% per flight in areas where FRAs
were open 24 hours a day [12]. Further extending FRAs could, therefore, lead to
substantial reductions to the total delay experienced when the corresponding effi-
ciencygainsareaggregatedoverallflights. Itishypothesizedthattheadvantages
ofdirectroutingareevenhigherwithdecentralizationasthetrafficvolumeallowed
into self-separated airspace would not be constrained by ATCo workload.
1.2.2.2. Safety and Robustness
In addition to improving route efficiency, arbitrary/direct routing is also expected
to distribute traffic more uniformly over the available airspace [15]; compare Fig-
ures1.5(a)and1.5(b). Thisincreasedutilizationoftheavailableairspacehasbeen
shown to reduce conflict probability, thereby increasing the safety of decentralized
airspace [15, 28, 29]. With centralized ATC, the opposite is true; airways artifi-
cially increase local traffic densities and therefore increase the chance of conflicts
between aircraft on the same airway.

intheairspace,italsoincreasestheoverallsystemrobustnesstohardwarefailures 1
when compared to centralized ATC [15, 30]. For example, if the automated CD&R
system of a self-separated aircraft fails, other aircraft would still be able to detect
and resolve conflicts with such non-nominal aircraft, i.e., the implicit redundancy
in the system reduces the chance of safety critical events. In contrast, hardware
failures at a central node of the current ATC system could severely affect safety.
For instance, if cyber-attacks cause the failure of radar and/or radio equipment
at an ACC, ATCos would no longer be able to identify and/or warn anypilots in
their sector of potential collisions, threatening the safety of allaircraft under their
control.
1.2.2.3. Capacity
As ATCo workload is no longer a constraining factor with decentralization, and be-
causeofthenumeroussafetyandefficiencybenefitsthatarisefromself-separation
and direct routing (see above), many previous studies have suggested that a tran-
sition to decentralized ATC could substantially increase the capacity of en route
airspace. However, quantitativemethods to measure and analyze the absolute
safetyandcapacityofdecentralizedATChavenotbeenwelldefined. Thedevelop-
mentofsuchmethodsisoneofthemaincontributionsofthisthesis,seesection1.4
for more details.
1.2.3. Previous Research
Decentralized ATC is not a new idea. In fact, the notion of distributing traffic sep-
aration tasks have been debated in literature since the introduction of automated
ATCsystemsandRNAVinthemid-1970s[2]. SuchideaswereformalizedbytheRa-
dioTechnicalCommissionforAeronautics(RTCA)in1995withthedefinitionofthe
so called ‘Free-Flight’ concept. Free-Flight focused on increasing airspace capacity
by providing operators with “the freedom to select their path and speed in real
time” [31]. Furthermore, “traffic restrictions were only [to be] imposed to ensure
separation…and safety” [31]. Since then, many studies on decentralized ATC have
been performed under the banner of the Free Flight concept, and have focused
on four main aspects: conceptual design and the role of ATCos, airborne CD&R
algorithms, human factors issues surrounding self-separation, and the integration
of unmanned/personal aerial vehicles into low altitude urban airspaces.
1.2.3.1. ConceptualDesignandtheRoleofAirTrafficControllers
Initial research in this domain focused on developing operational concepts for de-
centralized airspace that could viably reduce traffic flow constraints without affect-
ing safety. Several different concepts emerged. These concepts mainly differed
in terms of the roles assigned to ATCos, and the task-allocation that is required
between ATCos and pilots to increase capacity. These concepts can be classified
into three broad categories: partial delegation of separation tasks, full delegation
of separation tasks, and the sector-less ATC concept.

--- Page 27 ---

8 1. Introduction
1 With partial delegation, tactical separation responsibilities are transferred to only
thosepilotswhorequestit,andthedurationandscopeofsuchdelegationisdeter-
mined by ATCos as part of their boarder control strategy [32–36]. Therefore, this
approachaimstoincreasecapacitybyreducingATCoworkload,whilecontinuingto
provide ATCos with the overall strategic control of traffic.
In contrast, with full delegation, aircrews are entirely responsible for separation
with all surrounding traffic, and this form of decentralization is often referred to as
self-separation [30,37–39]. Here,theaimistoincreasecapacitybyallowingself-
optimizationoftheroutesofindividualflights. Inessence,thisapproachtransforms
controlledairspaceintouncontrolledairspacewhereATCosarenotactivelyinvolved
inseparatingaircraft(exceptwhenanemergencyisdeclared). Instead,ATCosare
required to regulate the number of aircraft allowed into self-separated airspace
such that overall system safety is maintained at the required level, i.e., under this
scenario, ATCos perform traffic flow management tasks.
In the recent past, a new type of decentralized ATC has been proposed that lies
in between the current centralized system and fully self-separated airspace. This
newconceptisoftenreferredtoasthe’sector-less’ATCconcept[40–42]. Itisalso
sometimesreferredtoastheflight-centricATCconcept. Inthisconcept,eachATCo
is responsible for safely separating one (or more) aircraft for the entire duration of
its flight through a large region of airspace, without handing over control to other
ATCos as aircraft transit from sector to sector. In this sense, sector-less ATC can
be thought of as a ground-based decentralized ATC concept. Research has shown
thatthisapproachimprovescapacityovercurrentoperationsbyprovidingairspace
users with more freedom to select their own routes while also increasing ATCo
efficiency.

1.2.3.2. Conflict Detection and Resolution Algorithms
BecausedecentralizingATCentailsmovingthetrafficseparationtasktothecockpit,
thevastmajorityofFree-Flightresearchhasfocusedondevelopingautomatedalgo-
rithmsforairborneConflictDetection&Resolution(CD&R).Asthenamesuggests,
CD&R consists of conflict detection and conflict resolution elements.
Conflict Detection (CD) is the process of predicting future separation violations. In
literature,CDalgorithmsarebroadlyclassifiedaseitherstate-basedorintent-based.
With state-based CD, linear extrapolations of aircraft positions over a prescribed
‘look-ahead’ time are used to predict losses of separation [20, 30]. On the other
hand, with intent-based CD, aircraft states and flight plan information regarding
thelocationsofalimitednumberoffuturewaypointsareusedintandemtodeduce
potential separation infringements [43, 44].

1.2. What is Decentralized ATC? 9
Once conflicts are predicted, they need to be resolved to maintain safety; this 1
process is known as Conflict Resolution (CR). A plethora of CR algorithms have
beendevelopedinthepast,rangingfromnature/physicsinspiredvoltage-potential
methods [20, 30, 45], to methods derived from differential game theory [46]. In
additiontoCRalgorithms,literaturealsoconsidersotherrelatedaspectssuchasthe
effect of the type of CR maneuver (horizontal/vertical/horizontal + vertical) [47],
and the effect of priority rules [30, 48], on the safety, efficiency and practicality of
decentralizedoperations. AreviewofCRalgorithmscanbefoundin[49,50].
In conjunction to CD&R, a limited number of studies have investigated the use of
Conflict Prevention (CP) algorithms. These algorithms, such as the Predictive Air-
borne Separation Assurance System (PASAS) [20, 30], aim to improve safety by
preventingaircraftfromturningintonewconflictswhenperformingconflictresolu-
tions (or nominal trajectory changes), thereby mitigating the possibility of conflict
chain reactions. Such chain reactions have a detrimental effect on the stability of
decentralized operations. The study of airspace stability, and its relationship to
airspacecapacity,isoneofthemainfocusesofthisthesis,seesection1.4formore
details.
1.2.3.3. Human Factors Research
Although it is technically feasible to realize a fully autonomous CD&R system on
commercialaircraft,asperexistingcockpitdesignprinciples,Free-Flightresearchers
have generally agreed that pilots should retain the final responsibility for ensur-
ing separation with surrounding aircraft. To aid pilots with this additional task,
many cockpit display interface concepts have been developed to help them visual-
ize neighboring traffic and impending conflicts. Some display designs also directly
portraypotentialconflictresolutionoptions[20,30],whileotherdesignsdepictthe
constraints with which pilots should resolve conflicts manually [51, 52].
Inmanycases,theeffectivenessoftheproposeddisplayinterfaceshavebeenvali-
dated using human-in-the-loop experiments. Some studies have used professional
airline flight crews and flight simulator trials for a wide variety of cases, including
finalapproachandlanding[20,30,53,54]. Theresultsofsuchempiricalinvestiga-
tionshaveindicatedthatthesupplementalCD&Rtasksdonotsignificantlyincrease
pilot workload, even for traffic densities that are three times greater, and for con-
flict rates that are nine times greater, than current European operations [20, 30].
In fact, the results of such experimental studies are often cited by Free-Flight re-
searchers as evidence of the increased airspace capacity offered by decentralized
ATC.
1.2.3.4. Integration of Unmanned and Personal Aerial Vehicles
Althoughdecentralizationwasoriginallyproposedtoimprovecommercialairtrans-
port operations, the concept has become increasingly popular as a means to inte-
grate unmanned and personal aerial vehicles into low altitude urban airspaces. In

10 1. Introduction
1 fact, much of the latest research in this domain now focuses on this context. This
isbecausemanyresearchersandaviationauthoritiesviewthedistributionoftraffic
separation tasks as a necessary step towards accommodating the incredible traffic
volumes foreseen for these new aircraft types [55, 56].
Due to the lack of operational experience with unmanned and personal aerial ve-
hicles, much of the initial research in this area has adapted or ‘borrowed’ meth-
ods from previous work on commercial decentralized ops. This includes the de-
velopment of new decentralized operational concepts [57–60], as well as the de-
velopment of new self-separation technologies for future aircraft types [50, 61,
62].

Both these airspace design elements are aimed at regulating ATCo workload to
manageable levels, in order to balance demand with capacity.
However, the use of such airspace design options to optimize decentralized traffic
flowshasbeenlargelyoverlookedinpreviousresearch. Infact,thereisnoconsen-
sus in existing literature on whether some form of traffic structuring is also bene-
ficial for decentralized ATC; although Free-Flight researchers advocate that higher
trafficdensitiescanbeachievedthroughareductionoftrafficrestrictions(seesec-
tion 1.2.3), other studies argue that capacity would benefit more from a further
structuring of traffic [35, 64, 65]. Such diametrically opposed views indicate that
there is no coherent understanding of the relationship between airspace structure
and capacity in existing literature.

1.3.2. Safety Modeling
1
As implied above, airspace design can directly affect the probability of conflict be-
tween aircraft. To quantify this effect, literature introduces the notion of ‘intrinsic
safety’[66,67]. Thisaspectofsafetyfocusesontheabilityofanairspacedesignto
prevent(some) conflicts fromoccurringdue tothe constraintsit imposeson traffic
motion,withouttheaidofsupplementalCRalgorithmsoractorssuchaspilotsand
ATCos.
Although previous studies have presented analytical methods to describe the in-
trinsic safety offered by an airspace design [66–70], most models have only con-
sidered conflicts between cruising aircraft. However, to fully quantify the intrinsic
safetyofferedbydecentralizedenrouteairspacedesigns,particularlyforthosewith
relativelylooseroutingconstraints, itisnecessarytotakeintoaccountinteractions
between aircraft in all relevant flight phases. Another limitation of many analytical
safety models derived previously is that they make use of idealistic assumptions
regarding the flow of traffic that do not always reflect realistic operations. There-
fore,existingmodelingapproacheswillneedtobeimprovedinrelationtothesetwo
aspects before they can be used to accurately compare different airspace design
options in terms of intrinsic safety.
1.3.3. Capacity Modeling
In ATC, it is often tempting to interrelate airspace safety and airspace capacity.
Althoughthesetwometricsarecloselyrelated,anincreaseofsafetydoesnotalways
guaranteeacorrespondingincreaseofcapacity. Thedifferencebetweensafetyand
capacity can be illustrated using the North Atlantic Organized Track System (NAT-
OTS).Thisairspacedesignconsistsofaseriesofpredefinedtrajectories,or‘tracks’,
that are used by traffic traveling between North America and Western Europe; see
Figure 1.6. The safety of this system can be improved by increasing the spacing
between these tracks. However, this would also reduce the efficiencywith which
the available airspace is utilized, which would in turn reduce the total number of
availabletracks,aswellasthemaximumcapacityofNAT-OTS.Forthisreason,when
evaluating the capacity of an ATC system, it is necessary to consider the effect of
a design on multiple airspace performance metrics in unison, including safety and
efficiency.
Because airspace safety and capacity are not equivalent, many previous studies
have adopted simplequalitativemethods to study the effect of decentralization on
capacity. AsindicatedbyFigure1.7,inmostcases,thesequalitativemethodsmea-
sure capacityindirectlyby analyzing the variation of safety and efficiency metrics,
as well as other relevant performance metrics, with traffic density using simulation
experiments. Although this approach facilitates a comparison of different designs,
when it is used to determine thecapacitylimitof particular design, it is often nec-
essary to use weighting factors to rank the relative importance of the considered
metrics. Because such weights are often selected arbitrarily, this approach can
lead to a biased estimation of airspace capacity. It is likely that morequantitative

search questions, have been defined.

1.4.1. Research Activity 1: Airspace Design

Thefirstresearchactivityaimstosystematicallystudytheeffectofairspacedesign
onthecapacityofdecentralizedATC.Asmentionedinsection1.3.1,previousstudies
do not provide a definitive understanding on the relationship between airspace
design and capacity for decentralization. Because a basic understanding of this
relationship is necessary before quantitative safety and capacity models can be
derived, the following research question has been defined:
Research Question on Airspace Design (Chapter 2)
RQ 1. How does thedegreeofstructuringof traffic by an airspace design
affect the capacity of decentralized ATC?
It should be noted that in this thesis, the terms ‘airspace structure’ and ‘airspace
design’ are used interchangeably. Both terms refer to procedural mechanisms for
aprioriseparation and organization of traffic. Furthermore, the phrase ‘degree of
structuring’ in RQ 1 denotes the number of constraints imposed on traffic motion
by an airspace design. Correspondingly, if airspace design Ais said to be ‘more
structured’ than airspace design B, this implies that design Aimposes a greater
number constraints on traffic motion than designB.
To tackle RQ 1, inchapter2, an empirical approach is used whereby four airspace
concepts of increasing structure are compared using fast-time simulation exper-
iments, for both nominal and non-nominal conditions. As particular emphasis is
placed on determining whether the optimal method of structuring airspace varies
withtrafficdensity,multipletrafficdemandscenariosaresimulated. Subsequently,
thestructure-capacityrelationshipisinferredfromtheeffectoftrafficdemandvari-
ations on a number of airspace performance metrics.
It is important to realize that the goal of this research activity is not to propose
operationally ready airspace concepts, or to compute precise capacity limits for
the four airspace concepts considered. Instead, the goal is only to study how the
degreeofstructuringoftrafficaffectscapacityfordecentralization. Amorequanti-
tative method to estimate the capacity limit of a decentralized airspace concept is
developed as part of research activity 3 (see below).
1.4.2. Research Activity 2: Safety Modeling
The second research activity is directed towards overcoming the shortcomings of
existing analytical conflict count models described in literature. As explained in
section1.3.2,thesemodelscanbeusedtoquantifyandcompareairspacedesignsin
termsoftheintrinsicsafetytheyprovide. However,mostcurrentmodelsarelimited
by the fact that they only consider conflicts between cruising aircraft. Additionally,
many such models make use of idealistic assumptions that limit the type of traffic

14 1. Introduction
1 flow patterns, or ‘traffic scenarios’, for which they are applicable. To address these
issues, the following two research questions are formulated as:
Research Questions on Safety Modeling (Chapters 3-4)
RQ 2. How can existing conflict count models be extended to take into
accountinteractionsbetweenaircraftindifferentflightphaseswhen
assessingtheoverallintrinsicsafetyprovidedbyanairspacedesign?
RQ 3. How sensitive are conflict count models to the trafficflow/scenario
assumptionsupon which they are derived, and is it possible to re-
lax the dependency of the models on these assumptions to further
improve their accuracy?
The second research question (RQ 2) focuses on expanding current conflict count
models from 2-D to 3-D airspaces by taking into account the effects of both the
horizontalandverticalmotionofaircraftonconflictcounts. Thedevelopedmethod,
described in chapter3, groups aircraft according to their flight phase, takes into
accounttheinteractionsthatoccurbetweenaircraftindifferentflightphasesbased
on the constraints imposed by a particular airspace design, while also considering
the proportion of aircraft in each flight phase. The resulting 3-D models allow
airspace designers to easily study the effects of physical airspace characteristics,
suchasairspacevolume,numberofflightlevels,separationminimaetc.,onintrinsic
safety. To investigate the accuracy of the derived models, model predictions are
compared to the results of several fast-time simulation experiments.
The approach described above to model the intrinsic safety of an airspace design
makes use of several assumptions regarding the distributions of aircraft speeds,
headings,altitudes,andspatiallocations. Collectively,thesefourdistributionsmake
upwhatisknownasa‘trafficscenario’. Thethirdresearchquestion(RQ3)assesses
the sensitivity of the 3-D analytical conflict count models to so called ‘ideal’ traffic
scenarioassumptions. Thisprocess,describedinchapter4,usestargetedfast-time

on the accuracy of the analytical conflict count models. The data collected from
thesesimulationsisalsousedtodevelop‘modeladjustments’thataimtogeneralize
themodelssuchthattheyareapplicableforawiderrangeoftrafficscenarios. The
model adjustments use numerical methods to compute complex integrals for non-
ideal traffic scenarios.
It should be noted that two specific airspace designs, namely unstructured and
layered airspace designs, described in section 2.2, are used as case studies in the
context of RQs 2 and 3. This is because the output of RQ 1 indicated that these
two modes of structuring leads to higher capacities when compared to the other
structuringoptionsinitiallyconsidered. Nonethelessthemethodsdevelopedinthis
thesis can also be applied to other airspace designs. The procedure to do so is
described in the corresponding chapters.

--- Page 34 ---

1.4. Research Objectives and Approach 15
Furthermore, it is also important to realize that the safety models derived in this 1
thesis do not aim to define a target level of safety for decentralized airspace con-
cepts. Instead, the goal of the models is to understand how the parameters of an
airspace design, such as heading range per flight level, affect safety. Because the
modelsprovidesuchanunderstanding,themodelsdevelopedherecanbeusedto
select the values of the design parameters of the airspace to achieve the desired
target level of safety (whatever that target may be).
1.4.3. Research Activity 3: Capacity Modeling
The final research activity aims to develop a comprehensive capacity assessment
frameworkfordecentralizedATC,taking intoaccountthe combinedeffectsofboth
airspacedesignandCD&Ralgorithmsonthesafetyandefficiencyoftravel. Tothis
end, the following research question has been defined:
Research Question on Capacity Modeling (Chapter 5)
RQ 4. HowcanthecombinedeffectsofairspacedesignandairborneCD&R
onthecapacitylimitofadecentralizedairspaceconceptbeestimated
withoutassigningweightingfactorstosafetyandefficiencymetrics?
Toanswerthefourthresearchquestion(RQ4),thisthesisusesthepreexistingno-
tionofairspacestabilitytodefinecapacity. Asdefinedinpreviousliterature,inthis
thesis,airspacestabilityconsiderstheoccurrenceandpropagationofconflictchain
reactions[32,33]. Suchchainreactionsareoftencausedbythescarcityofairspace
at high traffic densities, as well as due to the specific constraints imposed on traf-
fic motion by the selected airspace design, and by the specific conflict resolution
actions commanded by the selected algorithm for tactical CD&R. In addition to re-
ducingthesafetyoftheairspace,theroutedeviationsthatresultfromconflictchain
reactions also decrease the efficiency of aircraft trajectories. Therefore, a study of
the number of conflict chain reactions, or equally, a study of the rate of change of
airspace stability with traffic density, can be used as a directmeasure of airspace
capacity, without the need for arbitrary weighting factors; see Figure 1.8.
To determine the capacity limit of a decentralized airspace concept from the view-
point of airspace stability, a semi-empirical method is developed in chapter5to
compute the number of conflict chain reactions as a function of traffic density,
airspace design and CD&R algorithm. This method defines the capacity limit of a
decentralized airspace concept as the traffic density at which conflict chain reac-
tions propagate uncontrollably throughout the entire airspace. In other words, at
the capacity limit, all aircraft exist in a persistent state of conflict, as every conflict
resolution maneuver triggers infinite number of new conflicts. The capacity limit
is identified by combining analytical models that describe the safety performance
of an airspace design (i.e., the output RQ 2) with empirical models that describe
the actions of tactical CD&R algorithms. The resulting method is demonstrated

for a number of interesting conditions using fast-time simulations of decentralized
unstructured and layered airspace designs.
It should be noted that unlike currently used capacity metrics, which mainly focus
on throughput, the capacity model developed in this thesis measures capacity as
thesaturationdensityoftheairspace. Asmentionedabove,thissaturationdensity
isdefinedfromtheperspectiveofairspacestability. Therefore,capacity,asdefined
here,doesn’treflecttheoperationalcapacityofanairspace,butcanbeusedinstead
to compare different (airspace) concepts with each other.
1.5. Research Scope
To ensure that the topics addressed in this thesis are dealt with in sufficient de-
tail, the scope of this work has been limited in relation to the following seven as-
pects.
EnRouteAirspace
Results from previous studies have indicated that decentralization is most suitable
for en route airspace. Consequently, the research questions of this thesis are con-
sideredonlywithinthecontextofenrouteairspace,andthetrajectoriesofaircraft
outside this region of airspace are not considered in detail.
DecentralizedAirspaceType
AlthoughthereareseveraltypesofdecentralizedATCdefinedinliterature,seesec-
tion1.2.3.1,thisthesislimitsitsscopetothemostextremeversionofdecentraliza-
tion, namely airborne self-separation. This is because the fully automated nature
ofself-separatedairspaceisexpectedtoyieldthehighestcapacityincreaserelative
totoday’scentralizedATCsystem,particularlysincethecapacityofcentralizedATC
is limited mainly by the manual workload constraints of human ATCos.
Because self-separation is radically different toady’s ATC system, a potential intro-
ductionofafullyautomatedandself-separateddecentralizedATCsystemisunlikely
to occur overnight. However, aspects related to the practical issues related to the

--- Page 36 ---

1.5. Research Scope 17
implementation of self-separation is beyond the scope of this work. The reader is 1
referredto [20,72]forstudiesfocusingontheissuesrelatedtoatransitiontode-
centralized ATC, including the ramifications of mixed equipage operations, i.e., op-
erationsinwhichaircraftwithandwithoutCD&Rcapabilityflyinthesameairspace.
Additionally, since the focus is on fullyautomatedself-separation, human factors
issues, including issues related to the role of ATCos, in this form of ATC, is outside
the scope of this thesis.
TechnicalSystems
As mentioned before, ADS-B is regarded to be a key enabling technology for air-
borne CD&R. The ADS-B system is subject to communication delays and interfer-
ence. Nevertheless, a recent study has shown that these limitations have little
effectontheperformanceandrobustnessoftheairborneCD&Ralgorithmsconsid-
eredinthiswork[25]. Consequently,tosimplifythemodelingneededforfast-time
simulations, this work assumes perfect inter-aircraft communications.
On a similar note, human factors issues related to self-separation are not consid-
ered. Instead, it is assumed that CD&R tasks are performed fully autonomously.
For a comprehensive review of the human factors implications of self-separation,
the reader is referred to [53].
Non-NominalEventsandWeather
Non-nominaleventsandweatherareknowntohaveasignificanteffectonairspace
capacity. For this reason, the empirical study undertaken as part of RQ 1 takes
these elements into account using rogue aircraft and wind. Rogue aircraft, which
do not respect the routing constraints imposed by an airspace design, are used to
investigate the effects of deliberate rule breaking and aircraft that have suffered
technical failures. These rogue aircraft are also simulated to have separation min-
ima that are several times larger than nominal aircraft. Consequently, their motion
through the airspace is somewhat comparable to ‘no-go’ areas caused by convec-
tive weather systems. The wind that was simulated was not taken into account
during route planning. Hence, it was used to study the effects of wind prediction
uncertainties on capacity.
Developing quantitative methods to predict the effects stochastic events, such as
weather, on traffic flows is an ongoing area of research. Consequently, the safety
models developed as part of RQs 2-3 are only applicable for ideal conditions. The
semi-empirical capacity assessment method developed in response to RQ 4 can,
on the other hand, be used to study the effects of such stochastic operational
conditions on capacity, as long as adequately realistic simulation models can be
developed for the required use cases.
ConflictDetection
BeforethemethodusedforConflictDetection(CD)canbediscussed,itisnecessary
to properly define the notion of a ‘conflict’, and how it differs from an ‘intrusion’.
A conflict occurs if the horizontal and vertical distances between two aircraft are
expected to be less than the prescribed separation standards within a predeter-
mined ‘look-ahead’ time. Conflicts, are therefore predictions of futureseparation

violations. Conflicts should not be confused with intrusions. Instead, intrusions,
also referred to as losses of separation, occur when separation requirements are
violated at the presenttime. This distinction between conflicts and intrusions is
shown in Figure 1.9.
The so called ‘state-based’ CD method is used throughout this thesis. With this
form of CD, conflicts are detected using linear extrapolation of aircraft positions,
assuming constant velocity vectors within the predefined look-ahead time. State-
based CD was selected for this study because it is an easy to understand and
replicable form of CD, and as such it is used by the vast majority of research in
this area. The mathematical formulation for state-based CD can be found in [20,
52]. The separation standards used are clearly described in the ‘simulation design’
sections of each chapter.
ConflictResolutionandPrevention
TheModifiedVoltagePotential(MVP)algorithmisusedfortacticalairborneConflict
Resolution (CR). This method uses the repulsion of similarly charged particles to
resolveconflictsinapair-wisefashion,andresultsinminimumdeviationresolution
maneuvers. MVP was selected because research performed along side this PhD
showed that it resulted in the lowest number of conflicts when compared other
types of algorithms, e.g. swarming. It was also found to be very effective for
solvingbottleneckscenariosinextremedensities. Thereaderisrefereedto[25,73]
on studies investigating the performance of MVP.
The allowed resolution directions and priority are airspace design dependent, and
are discussed in the appropriate chapters that follow. The procedure to calculate
conflict resolution vectors using MVP can be found in [20]. In addition to tactical
CR,thePASASConflictPrevention(CP)algorithm,describedinsection1.2.3.2,has
been used as part of the empirical study for RQ 1.

SimulationPlatformsandAircraftTypes 1
This thesis uses two different fast-time simulation platforms, namely TMX and
BlueSky. Additionally, Aircraft Performance Models (APMs) corresponding to Per-
sonalAerialVehicles(PAVs)andnormalcommercialairlinerswereused. Thereason
for the different simulation platforms and aircraft types has to do with the context
of this work.
The first research question (RQ1) was performed as part of the Metropolis project
(2014-2015). The Metropolis project focused on investigating the relationship be-
tweenairspacestructureandcapacityusingsimulationexperiments. Torealizethe
extreme traffic densities needed to study this relationship using simulations alone,
theMetropolisprojectadoptedthecontextofaPersonalAerialTransportationSys-
tem (PATS). For these simulations, the TMX software belonging to the National
Aerospace Laboratory of the Netherlands (NLR), a member of the Metropolis con-
sortium, was used. Furthermore, because Metropolis simulations were performed
using the PATS setting, APMs for PAVs were used. Such PAV APMs were devel-
oped by modifying Eurocontrol’s Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) APMs for fixed wing
generalaviationaircraftwith the parametersof PAVsthat werefoundon the inter-
net. Therefore, for the most part, these PAV models behaved identical to normal
fixed-wind aircraft (main difference was slower speeds).
AftertheMetropolisproject,accesstoTMXwasnotallowedsinceitisaproprietary
NLRsoftware. Therefore,thestudiesrelatedtoRQs2-4usedtheBlueSkysimulator
developed at TU Delft. BlueSky is the open-source successor to TMX. BlueSky and
TMX are extremely similar programs and the core of these simulators were both
developed by Prof.dr.ir. Jacco Hoekstra, and therefore use the same underlying
algorithmsandmodelsformanyfunctions. Infact,fromtheuserperspective,there
isnodifferencesincebothprogramsusethesametrafficcommandsyntax. Forthis
reason,theswitchfromTMXtoBlueSkyisnotexpectedtoaffecttheresults.
In contrast to RQ 1, where simulations were used to study traffic dynamics, the
simulations performed in the context of RQs 2-4 aimed to validate the safety and
capacitymodelsdevelopedinthisthesis. Becausethegoalofthelattersimulations

Analysis of Airspace Design
for Decentralized
Separation
Asindicatedinchapter1,existingliteraturedoesnotprovideadefinitiveun-
derstanding on the relationship between airspace design and the capacity
of decentralized ATC. A basic understanding of this relationship is neces-
sary before quantitative safety and capacity modelling methods can be de-
veloped. This chapter aims to provide such an understanding by comparing
four airspace design concepts of increasing structure using fast-time simu-
lationexperiments,forbothnominalandnon-nominalconditions,aswellas
formultipletrafficdemanddensities.
The work contained in this chapter was performed as part of the Metropo-
lis project (2014-2015). To realize the extreme traffic densities needed to

2.1. Introduction
Atpresent,trafficseparationinen-routeairspaceisprimarilyperformedbyground-
basedAirTrafficControllers(ATCo),andreliesonarigidnetworkofairways[75,76].
Thestructureofthisnetworkhistoricallydependedonthephysicallocationofradio
navigation beacons, dating back to the early 1950s [1]. This airway system was
devised to help pilots navigate safely under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), using
simplesinglechannelradios[1]. Eventhoughmodernairlinershavethenecessary
equipment to fly arbitrary routes accurately, airway navigation is still used during
busy daytime operations in most parts of the world [13]. This is because airways
limitaircraftflightpathsalongpredefinedtrajectories,makingiteasierfortheATCo
tomonitorandde-conflicttrafficflows[30,45]. However,asairwaysdonotalways
allow for efficient airspace usage, thiscentralizedairspace design has been widely
reported to be nearing saturation levels [13, 14, 18, 77].
In order to cope with the projected increases in traffic demand, a transfer of the
traffic separation responsibility from the ground to the cockpit has been proposed
as an alternative to the current operational model. To realize the resultingdecen-
tralizedseparation paradigm, sometimes referred to as ‘self-separation’, significant
progress has been made towards the development of airborne Conflict Detection
and Resolution (CD&R) algorithms [49]. However, little effort has been devoted
towards decentralized airspacedesign. In particular, there is no consensus in ex-
isting literature if some form of traffic organization, or structuring, is also needed
to maximize capacity for decentralized separation; while Free Flight researchers
advocate that higher densities can be achieved through a reduction of traffic flow
constraints[30,39,78],otherstudiesarguethatcapacitywouldbenefitmorefrom
a further structuring of airspace [35, 64, 65]. These diametrically opposed views

2.2. Design of Airspace Concepts 27
indicate that the relationship between airspace structure and capacity is not well
understood for decentralization, i.e. does more or less structuring lead to a higher
capacity? Or, does the degree of structuring required to maximize capacity vary
with traffic density?
2
To answer these questions, this study analyzes the degree of structuring needed
to maximize capacity for decentralized separation using fast-time simulations. To
this end, four en-route airspace concepts, ranging from a completely unstructured
direct routing concept, to a highly structured tube network using 4D trajectories,
arecomparedwithinthesamesimulationenvironment, formultipletrafficdemand
scenarios. The effect of structure on capacity is subsequently analyzed from the
effectoftrafficdemandvariationsonsafety,efficiency,stability,arrivalsequencing,
complexityandnoisepollutionmetrics. Byincludingrogueaircraftthatignorecon-
cept dependent routing requirements in selected simulation runs, the robustness
of the concepts to non-nominal conditions is also analyzed in this study.
Theanalysisdescribedinthisworkisperformedwithinthecontextofahypothetical
Personal Aerial Transportation System (PATS). This setting was adopted to provide
theextremetrafficdensities,upto30,000aircraftper10,000squarenauticalmiles,
needed to ‘stress-test’ and compare the four concepts in terms of capacity using
a fast-time simulation approach. Note that the aim of this study is not to provide
any specific conclusions regarding design options for a future PATS; the focus is
onlyontheanalysisoftheairspacestructure-capacityrelationshipfordecentralized
separation.
This chapter is structured as follows. Section 2.2 defines the notion of airspace
structure, and describes the design of four decentralized airspace concepts of in-
creasing structure. This is followed in section 2.3 with the setup of two separate
simulationstudiesthatareusedtocomparetheconcepts. Theresultsofthesesim-
ulations are presented and discussed in sections 2.4 and ??, respectively. Finally
the main conclusions are summarized in section ??.
2.2. Design of Airspace Concepts
Airspacestructurecanbedefinedasaproceduralmechanismforaprioriseparation
and organization of en-route traffic. An example of this in current-day operations
is the hemispheric rule, which separates east-bound from west-bound traffic at
alternating vertical flight levels [79]. More generally, any a priori structuring of
traffic implies posingconstraintson one or more of the four degrees of freedom
thatdescribeaircraftmotion(bothspatialaswellastemporal). Usingthisdefinition
ofairspacestructure,fourdecentralizedairspaceconcepts,namedFullMix,Layers,
Zones and Tubes, have been designed by incrementally increasing the number of
constraints applied. This section describes and compares the conceptual design of
these four airspace concepts.

28 2. Analysis of Airspace Design for Decentralized Separation
2.2.1. Full Mix
The Full Mix airspace concept can be most aptly described as ‘completely unstruc-
turedairspace’. Here,noconstraintsareimposedonaircraftmotioninthisconcept.

efficiency. Therefore, aircraft are free to use direct horizontal routes, as long as
suchroutingisnotobstructedbyweatherorstaticobstacles. Similarly,aircraftcan
alsoflywithpreferredspeedsandatoptimumaltitudes,basedontheirperformance
capabilitiesandtripdistances. Byofferinggreaterfreedomtoaircraftoperators,UA
has been found to result in a more uniform distribution of traffic, both horizontally
and vertically, reducing traffic concentrations and ensuing delays [29, 30].
As no level of airspace structure is used to separate potentially conflicting trajec-
tories in Full Mix, safe separation between aircraft is entirely dependent on air-
borne self-separation automation, see section 2.3.1.3. Since Full Mix imposes no
constraints on the path of aircraft, combined heading, speed and altitude conflict
resolutionmaneuversareusedtoreducedeviationsfromtheoptimalroute.
2.2.2. Layers
The Layers concept can be seen as an extension to the hemispheric rule [79]. In
thisconcept,theairspaceissegmentedintoverticallystackedbands,andheading-
altituderulesareusedtolimittherangeoftraveldirectionsallowedineachaltitude
layer. Thissegmentationofairspaceisexpectedtoimprovesafetywhencompared
to the Full Mix concept, by reducingthe probabilityof conflicts with crossingtraffic
forcruisingaircraft. However,thisincreasedsafetycomesatthepriceofefficiency;
while direct horizontal routes are still possible, vertical flight profiles are dictated
bytheheading-altituderulesin-force. Asaresult,flightsmaynotbeabletocruise
at their optimum flight levels, increasing fuel burn when compared to Full Mix. An
exceptiontotheheading-altituderuleismadeforclimbinganddescendingaircraft;
theseaircraftareallowedtomaintainheadingwhileclimbingordescendingtotheir
destination altitude.
Figure2.1displaysaschematicoftheLayersconcept. Hereitcanbeseenthateach
altitude layer corresponds to a heading range of 45(cid:4968) and has a height of 300 ft.
With these dimensions, two complete sets of layers fit within the airspace volume
used to compare concepts, see section 2.3.2.1. As a result, short flights can stay
at low altitudes while longer flights can improve fuel burn by flying at higher flight
levels. This is expected to mitigate the efficiency drop of predetermined altitudes
in this concept.
TheLayersconceptalsomakesuseofthesameself-separationautomationutilized
by Full Mix, albeit with restrictions on the allowed resolution maneuvers. While
combined heading, speed and altitude resolutions are permitted for climbing and
descending traffic, for cruising aircraft, altitude resolutions would create new con-
flicts with traffic in adjacent layers. Resolutions are therefore limited to combined
heading and speed maneuvers for cruising aircraft.

2.2.3. Zones
Similar to Layers, the Zones concept separates traffic based on similarity of travel
direction. However, in this case, a horizontal segmentation of airspace is used to
separate traffic along pre-defined trajectories. In this respect, the Zones concept
resembles the airway-based airspace design used today in that it facilitates travel
towards and away from locations with high traffic demand.
The horizontal topology used by the Zones concept, see in Figure 2.2, consists of
two major zone types: radial and ring zones. Radial zones separate inbound and
outboundtrafficfromthecenterofthetopology,whichcoincideswithanareawith
hightrafficdemand. Concentricringzones,ontheotherhand,functionasconnec-
tions between the radial zones, and separates clockwise and anti-clockwise traffic
flows from each other. Aircraft can travel between any two points in the topology
usingacombinationofradialandringzones. Asthereisnoverticalsegmentationof
airspaceinthisconcept,optimumaltitudesareselectedbasedontheplannedflight
distance between origin and destination. The Zones concept used for simulations
consisted of 41 rings. The number of radials depended on the distance from the
centerofthetopologytoensureadequateseparationbetweenadjacentradials;72
radialswereusedfordistancesupto6Nmifromthecenter,afterwhich216radials
were defined.
The Zones concept also uses self-separation automation to separate aircraft flying
within the same zone, as well as to assist with the merging of aircraft between
ring and radial zones. Since the Zones topology dictates the horizontal path of an
aircraft, heading resolutions are not allowed for this concept.

2.2.4. Tubes
Asamaximumstructuringofairspace,thefinalconceptimplementsfour-dimensional
tubes that provide a fixed route structure in the air. Here, the aim is to increase
the predictability of traffic flows by using preplanned conflict free routes.
The tube topology can be thought of as a graph with nodes and edges, see Fig-
ure 2.3. The nodes are connection points for one or more routes, while the edges
are the tubes connecting two nodes. Tubes at the same horizontal level never in-
tersect, except at the nodes, and are dimensioned to fit exactly one aircraft in the
vertical and horizontal plane. To provide multiple route alternatives, the Tubes im-
plementation uses a total of 13 tube layers that are placed above each other, with
decreasing granularity. This way, short flights profit from a fine grid at the lowest
layer, while at the same time, longer flights benefit from lengthier tubes at higher
layers. Finally, it should be noted that aircraft are only allowed to climb/descend
through one tube layer at a time.
Unlike the other concepts, the Tubes concept uses time-based separation. This
modeofseparationdictatesthatwhenanaircraftpassesanode,itwill‘occupy’that
nodeforaprescribedtimeinterval. Withinthisoccupancyintervalnootheraircraft
isallowedtopassthroughthatnodetopreventconflicts. Foreachnode,aninterval
listismaintainedthatkeepstrackofthetimesatwhichthatnodeisexpectedtobe
occupied. These lists are shared between all aircraft, and updated whenever new
flightsenterthenetwork. Furthermore,newflightsareonlyallowedtoselectroutes
that are not predicted to conflict with existing aircraft in the network. If no such
route can be found, a pre-departure delay is applied in multiples of 10 seconds up
to a maximum of 30 minutes. After this period, the tube network was considered
to be saturated, and that particular flight is canceled. To ensure that separation at
the nodes also guarantees separation within the tubes, all aircraft within the same
layer are required to fly at the same velocity. This prescribed speed increases with

the altitude of the layer to match the decreasing granularity of the tube network.
A major advantage of this mode of separation is that it allows the tube network to
bebidirectional,astheoccupancyofanodeisindependentoftraveldirection. This
simplifies its design, and enables a closer packing of tubes in the topology.
The time-based separation and the pre-planned routes used by the Tubes concept
makesitsomewhatsimilartosome4DTrajectoryBasedOperations(TBO)concepts
that have been discussed in literature. However, it should be noted that most TBO
concepts utilize a centralizedplanning approach in which globally optimum routes
are determined using an iterative process, after negotiations between an airspace
user and an Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) [65]. Aircraft in the Tubes
concept,ontheotherhand,usedecentralizedrouteplanningwherebytheshortest
(conflict free) route is selected, given the availability of the tube topology at the
timeofflightplancalculation,i.e.,routesareselectedinTubesusingthe‘first-come-
first-served’ principle. Moreover, the Tubes concept uses a predefined topology for
route planning, while this is not strictly necessary for 4D TBO. Finally, (some) 4D
TBOconceptsofferthepossibilityofre-planningroutesaftertake-off,whereasthis
functionalityisnotavailableforTubes. Becauseofthesedifferences,itisimportant
not to equate Tubes and 4D TBO.
2.2.5. Concept Comparison
Figure 2.4 compares the four airspace concepts described above in terms of the
number of constrained degrees of freedom. The figure shows that options for
trajectory planning become increasingly restricted as the degree of structure is in-
crementally increased from Full Mix to Tubes; while all four degrees of freedom
are available in Full Mix, in the Tubes concept, aircraft have no degrees of free-
dom, and are required to rigidly follow preplanned space-time routes through a
predefinedtopology. Betweenthesetwoextremes,theLayersandZonesconcepts
were defined to allow three and two degrees of freedom respectively. This choice
was made such that the four concepts span the entire range from unstructured to
structuredairspace. Thus,acomparisonofthefourconceptsusingfast-timesimu-

2.3. Simulation Design
Twoseparatefast-timesimulationexperimentswereconductedtocomparethefour
airspace concepts in terms of capacity and robustness. This section describes the
2 design of these two experiments.
2.3.1. Simulation Development
2.3.1.1. Simulation Platform and Vehicle Modeling
TheTrafficManager(TMX)software,developedbytheNationalAerospaceLabora-
toryoftheNetherlands(NLR),wasusedasthesimulationplatforminthisresearch.
TheTMXsimulatoriswellestablishedintheATMresearchcommunity,andhasbeen
usedinmanypreviousAirTrafficManagement(ATM)relatedsimulationstudies. For
more information on TMX capabilities, the reader is referred to [80].

PerformanceModels(APM)[81],wereadaptedtomatchtheperformancespecifica-
tionsofseveralPAVsthatarecurrentlyunderdevelopment. Intotal,threedifferent
PAV types were used in the simulations.
2.3.1.2. Concept Implementation
ThefourconceptswereimplementedbymodifyingTMX’strajectoryplanningfunc-
tions. The Full Mix concept used the direct horizontal route and the most fuel ef-
ficient altitude, as determined by the APMs. Layers also used the direct horizontal
trajectory. However, altitude was selected based on the bearing to the destination
and the matching altitude from a predefined list (see section 2.2.2). Additionally,
distancedeterminedthechoicebetweentheupperandlowerlayersets;flightswith
a cruising distance less than 22 Nmi used the lower layer set.
For the Zones concept, the A* path planning algorithm was used to determine the
shortest route over its predefined horizontal topology, while the most fuel efficient
altitude was chosen by the APMs. Tubes also employed A* to calculate the short-
est path, but in this case, it was also used to examine whether the selected route
was conflict-free. Here, an instantaneous planning approach was used whereby
the occupancy of each node along a proposed route was checked at traffic desired
departure times. If any node along a proposed route was found to be occupied
by another flight, the corresponding route was discarded, and the A* algorithm
backtracked to evaluate the next best solution. If no route could be found, a pre-
departure delay was applied in multiples of 10 seconds up to a maximum of 30
minutes. After this period, the tube network was considered to be saturated, and
that flight was canceled. Once an appropriate route was found, aircraft were re-
quiredtofollowtheirpreplannedroutesascloselyaspossible,includingarrivaltime
intervals at each node.

--- Page 54 ---

2.3. Simulation Design 35
For both Zones and Tubes, the A* algorithm used in this work had to be modi-
fied from the generic version. This was because origins and destinations for traffic
were located outside the airspace volume used to design the concepts (see sec-
tion 2.3.2.1). Consequently, the generic A* algorithm could yield unfeasible so-
lutions due to aircraft bank angle limitations imposed by the APMs. To solve this 2
problem, the A* implementation in this work differs slightly from the conventional
algorithmbyallowingalreadyvisitednodestoberecheckedifbankanglelimitswere
exceeded,i.e.,byremarking‘closednodes’as‘opennodes’. Acompletedescription
of the A* algorithm can be found in [82].
2.3.1.3. Self-Separation Automation
TheFullMix,LayersandZonesconceptsreliedonairborneself-separationautoma-
tionfortacticalseparation. ItconsistedofseparateConflictDetection(CD),Conflict
Resolution (CR) and Conflict Prevention (CP) modules. CD was performed through
linear extrapolation of aircraft positions over a prescribed ‘look-ahead’ time. Once
conflicts were predicted, the Modified Voltage Potential (MVP) algorithm was used
for CR in a pair wise fashion, resulting in implicit cooperative resolution strategies.
Finally, the CP algorithm ensured that aircraft did not turn into conflicts, in an ef-
fort to mitigate conflict chain reactions. Previous research showed that this three
prongedsystemwashighlyeffectiveinsolvingmulti-aircraftconflicts. Furthermore,
this system was found to be computationally efficient as each aircraft is only con-
cerned with its own separation with neighboring traffic. For more details, please
consult [20].
Based on initial test runs, a look-ahead time of 60 seconds, as well as separation
margins of 0.135 Nmi horizontally and 150 ft vertically, were found to be suitable
for the APMs used here. Since the focus of this study is on decentralized en-route
airspace,self-separationwasperformedonlywithintheexperimentairspaceblock,
defined to be between 1650-6500 ft (see section 2.3.2.1). Additionally, aircraft
were assumed to have perfect knowledge of the states of neighboring traffic to
focus exclusively on the structure-capacity relationship.
2.3.1.4. Wind
Inreal-lifeoperations, winduncertaintiesareacommonsourceofpredictionerror.
To take this effect into account, wind was deliberately omitted from the simula-
tion’strajectoryplanningfunctionstostudytheeffectofuncertainties,whichcould
cause deviations from the planned trajectory, on the four airspace concepts. To
thisend,windwasmodeledasauniformandtime-invariantvectorfieldinx,yand
z,withrandomdirectionandrandomspeed(12-22kts). Althoughtheseconditions
cannot be assumed by default, for a short time interval in a small observed area,
and at sufficient altitudes to clear ground obstacles, as for the current study, this
assumption is adequate for the purposes of this work.

2.3.2. Traffic Scenarios
2.3.2.1. Testing Region and Flight Profiles
Tocreatehighdensitytrafficscenarios,asmallsquareregion,withanareaof1600
2 Nmi(cid:4796), was used for traffic simulations. Although this research focuses on en-route
airspacedesign,arrivalanddepartureoperationsweresimulatedtoensurethatthe
results did not ignore the impact of ground constraints. Correspondingly, aircraft
took-offfromoneof1600arrival/departurelocationsthatwereevenlydistributedat
groundlevel,againstthedirectionofthewind. Topreventtake-offconflicts,aircraft
hadaminimumcreationintervalof60secondsateachorigin,correspondingtothe
CD look-ahead time.
After take-off, aircraft climbed to the ‘experiment airspace block’, defined between
1650 ft and 6500 ft. Once aircraft entered the experiment block, they followed
concept dependent routing requirements, both horizontally and vertically. At a
predetermined distance from their destination (which depended on the cruise alti-
tude),aircraftdescendedoutoftheexperimentblock. Standardizedclimb/descent
profiles were used below the experiment block for all airspace concepts, and were
specifiedusingtheAPMs. Tosimplifysimulationdevelopment,runwaycapacitywas
notmanagedduringlanding. Instead,theeffectofarrivalswasanalyzedusingthe
‘arrival sequencing’ metric, see section 2.3.5.4.
Relativelylowaltitudeswereselectedfortheexperimentblocktolimitthehorizontal
area needed for simulation. Given the constant climb/descent profiles below the
experimentblock,higheraltitudeswouldhaveincreasedthehorizontalareaneeded
forthesimulations. Alargerareawouldinturnincreasethetrafficvolumesneeded
to realize the desired densities, increasing computational effort without tangible
benefits in terms of the primary research goals. On a similar note, all aircraft
took-off from and landed at one of the 1600 arrival/departure locations that were
defined in the square simulation area. Interactions with aircraft outside this area
wouldnotcontributeheavilytoanunderstandingoftheairspacestructure-capacity
relationship, particularly for decentralization. Thus, such interactions are outside
the scope of this work.
2.3.2.2. Traffic Demand
Fourtrafficdemandscenariosofincreasingdensitywereusedtocomparethecon-
cepts, and were defined in terms of the instantaneous number of aircraft in the
air, see Table 2.1. These scenarios had a an average trip distance and speed of 30
Nmi and 120 kts, respectively, and made use of assumptions for future per capita
demand for PAVs, see [57] for more details.
In addition to different demand volumes, traffic scenarios were created with dif-
ferent demand patterns. Here, scenarios with largely converging, diverging and
‘mixed’ demand patterns were used. These different demand patterns were cre-
ated by varying the ratio of origins and destinations that acted as sources and

sinks, and by varying the aircraft creation time intervals in different regions of the
simulation area.
2.3.2.3. Rogue Aircraft
Inaseparateexperiment,‘rogueaircraft’wereintroducedatrandomtimeintervals.
Theirseparationrequirementswereseventimeslargerhorizontally,andfourtimes
larger vertically, when compared to normal aircraft in the simulation. These air-
craftflewhaphazardlythroughtheairspacewithcontinuouslyvaryingheadingand
altitude. Furthermore, rogue aircraft were non-cooperative. This meant that nor-
malaircraftweresolelyresponsiblefordetectingandresolvingconflictswithrogue
aircraft using its self-separation automation, in all concepts. Although time based
separationisusedinTubes,theself-separationautomationdescribedaboveisused
with speed resolutions to resolve conflicts with rogue aircraft alone. By monitoring
the effect of rogue aircraft on safety metrics, the robustness of the four concepts
to non-nominal events can be analyzed.
2.3.3. Simulation Procedure and Data Logging
To enable a fair comparison between all concepts, standardized simulation condi-
tions were used to minimize unsystematic variation in the results. For a particular
repetition of a traffic demand volume, the creation times of aircraft, the origin-
destinationcombinations,thestrengthanddirectionofthesimulatedwind,aswell
as the introduction and trajectories of rogue aircraft (in non-nominal experiment),
were kept constant across all concepts. Additionally, scenarios had a duration of
two hours, consisting of a 45 minute (traffic volume) build up period, a 1 hour
logging period, during which the traffic volume was held constant at the required
level, and a 15 minute wind down period, required to allow aircraft created during
the logging hour to finish their flights, and prevent abnormally short flights from
skewing the results.
Twotypesofloggingwereused. Event-drivenloggingkepttrackofthepropertiesof
conflicts and intrusions as they occurred. It was also used to store flight efficiency
datawhenanaircraftarrivedatitsdestination,includingthetimeintervalbetween
consecutive arrivals at each destination. Periodic logging was used to monitor the
status of all flights in the experiment airspace block every 30 seconds. This was
required to monitor traffic volumes, as well as for computing structural complexity
and noise pollution metrics.

2.3.4. Independent Variables
Two separate experiments were performed: the nominal experiment and the non-
nominal experiment.
2
2.3.4.1. Nominal Experiment
The nominal experiment focused on the impact of airspace structure on capac-
ity under ideal conditions; although traffic was subjected to a uniform wind field
(see section 2.3.1.4), no other detriments to aircraft motion were included in this
experiment. The two independent variables of this experiment, and their levels,
are:
1. Airspace concept: Full Mix, Layers, Zones and Tubes
2. Traffic demand: Low, Medium, High and Ultra (see Table 2.1)
Foreachofthe16experimentconditions,sixrepetitionswereperformed,consisting
oftwoconverging,twodivergingandtwomixedtrafficdemandpatterns. Addition-
ally, the scenarios were also simulated with and without tactical CR to measure
airspace stability, resulting in a total of 192 nominal simulation runs (4 concepts x
4 demand scenarios x 6 repetitions x 2 CR settings).
2.3.4.2. Non-Nominal Experiment
The goal of the second experiment was to compare the relative robustness of the
conceptstonon-nominalsituations. Forthispurpose,rogueaircraftwereaddedto
trafficscenariosduringthelogginghour,inadditiontowind. Thetwoindependent
variables of this experiment, and their levels, are:
1. Airspace concept: Full Mix, Layers, Zones and Tubes
2. Number of rogue aircraft: 4, 8, 16 and 32
The resulting 16 non-nominal experiment conditions were performed using the
‘Medium’trafficdemandscenariolistedinTable2.1. Onceagain,sixrepetitions,as
wellassimulationswithandwithouttacticalCRwereperformed,resultinginatotal
of192non-nominalsimulationruns(4conceptsx4roguescenariosx6repetitions
x 2 CR settings).
To determine the number of rogue aircraft needed, pilot simulation runs were per-
formed for testing purposes. These runs indicated that a minimum of 15 rogue
aircraftperhourwereneededtoseesomeeffectofrogueaircraftforunstructured
airspace. Consequently 4, 8, 16 and 32 aircraft were selected to be below and
above this threshold for a proper experiment design.

2.3. Simulation Design 39
2.3.5. Dependent Variables
Six categories of dependent variables are used to compare the concepts: safety,
efficiency, stability, arrival sequencing, structural complexity and noise pollution.
The metrics used to access each category are described below.
2
2.3.5.1. Safety
Safetymetricsfocusontheabilityofanairspaceconcepttomaintainsafeseparation
between aircraft. Separation performance is measured in terms of the number of
intrusions and conflicts. Here, intrusions are defined as violations of minimum
separation requirements, while conflicts are defined as predicted intrusions, i.e.,
whentwo(ormore)aircraftareexpectedtoviolateseparationrequirementswithin
a predetermined ‘look-ahead’ time (60 seconds in this research).
Intrusionsdonotimplycollisions. Therefore,inadditiontocountingthenumberof
intrusions,itisimportanttoconsidertheseverityofanintrusion. Theseverityofan
intrusion, 𝐼 , is dependent on the path of an aircraft through the protected zone
(cid:4972)(cid:4958)(cid:4975)
of another, see Figure 2.5, and is computed using the following expression:
𝐼 = max[min(𝐼̂ (𝑡),𝐼̂ (𝑡))] (2.1)
(cid:4972)(cid:4958)(cid:4975) (cid:4935) (cid:4949)
(cid:4973)(cid:5042)(cid:4805)(cid:4973)(cid:5043)
Here, 𝐼̂ and 𝐼̂ are the magnitudes of horizontal and vertical intrusions that are
(cid:4935) (cid:4949)
normalized with respect to the corresponding minimum separation requirements,
while𝑡 and𝑡 arethestartandendtimesofanintrusion. Usingtheaboverelation,
(cid:4794) (cid:4795)
the intrusion severity for the intrusion path shown in Figure 2.5 is equal to the
normalized horizontal intrusion at point ‘A’.
The last safety metric is Intrusion Prevention Rate (IPR). As the name suggests,
this metric considers the proportion of intrusions that were successfully avoided,
and is computed as follows:
𝐶 −𝐼
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965) (cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965)

2.3.5.2. Efficiency
2
The efficiency of the concepts is analyzed using the work done metric. This met-
ric considers the optimality of an aircraft’s trajectory, and therefore has a strong
correlation with fuel/energy consumption. For each flight, the work done, 𝑊, is
computed as:
𝑊 = ∫ Γ⋅𝑑s (2.3)
(cid:4969)(cid:4954)(cid:4973)(cid:4961)
Here, Γ is the thrust vector and s is the displacement vector.
2.3.5.3. Stability

scarcityofairspace. Thestabilityoftheairspaceasadirectresultofconflictresolu-
tionmaneuvershasbeenmeasuredinliteratureusingtheDominoEffectParameter
(DEP) [33, 78]. The DEP can be visualized through the Venn diagram pictured in
Figure 2.6. Here, S1 is the set of all conflicts without resolutions, and S2 is the set
of all conflicts with resolutions, for identical traffic scenarios. Furthermore, three
regions can be identified in Figure 2.6 from the union and relative complements of
the two sets, with 𝑅1=𝑆1⧵𝑆2, 𝑅2=𝑆1∩𝑆2 and 𝑅3=𝑆2⧵𝑆1.
BycomparingthenumberofR1andR3conflicts,theproportionofadditional‘desta-
bilizing’ conflicts that were triggered by resolution maneuvers can be determined.
Thus, the DEP is defined as [33]:

2.3. Simulation Design 41
It should be noted that the Tubes concept does not use tactical conflict resolution
(expect with rogue aircraft). Hence, the DEP has no meaning for Tubes.
2.3.5.4. Arrival Sequencing
2
Although runway occupancy was not managed for landing traffic, the effect of
airspacestructureonapproachsequencingisexaminedaposterioribyconsidering
the time interval between successive arrivals at each destination. Both the num-
ber of arrivals within 60 seconds each other (equaling the CD look-ahead time),
andtheaveragetimeintervalbetweensuccessivearrivals,ateachdestination,has
been used to measure arrival sequencing.
2.3.5.5. Structural Complexity
Complexity metrics are used to measure the difficulty of controlling a given traf-
fic situation. Although complexity in ATM research often refers to ATCo workload,
the class of intrinsic, or geographical, complexity metrics, which only consider the
traffic patterns generated by an airspace concept, is most appropriate for this re-
search.
Two indicators are used to measure intrinsic complexity. The proximity indicator,
𝑃𝑅, describes the geographical distribution of aircraft within a specified volume of
airspace,enablingtheidentificationofspatialzoneswithhighlevelsofaggregation,
relative to the considered volume. On the other hand, the convergence indicator,
𝐶𝑉, measures the geometric distribution of aircraft speed vectors to distinguish
between converging and diverging traffic flows [83].
To compute intrinsic complexity, for each aircraft under consideration, a spatial
weighting window that is centered on that aircraft is opened. Then, a complex-
ity metric associated with the reference aircraft is determined by adding together
the product of the two above complexity factors for all pairs of aircraft within the
reference window:

Although aircraft positions are known accurately within the simulation, in real life
operations, there is always some uncertainty regarding the precise location of air-
craft. Toensureareliableandrobustcomplexityanalysis,itisnecessarytotakethis
effect into account. Therefore, the complexity metric shown above is extended by

Sincecomplexityisdefinedforaparticulartrafficsituationatagiventimeinstant,for
easier comparison of concepts, it is necessary to aggregate the robust complexity
metric, 𝐶𝑋(𝑡), over the total number of samples taken for each simulation run, 𝑛 .
(cid:4972)
This is done using a structural complexity metric, 𝑆𝐶𝑋, defined as:

𝑆𝐶𝑋 = ∑𝐶𝑋(𝑡)+𝛽max𝐶𝑋(𝑡); 𝑛∗ =max𝑛 (2.6)

to the trend of the 𝑆𝐶𝑋 metric were found for 𝛽 values between 0.01 and 0.3. For

2.3.5.6. Noise Pollution
Although this study focuses on en route airspace design, because of the relatively
low altitudes used by PAVs, the four airspace concepts are compared in terms of
noise pollution. Noise pollution is analyzed using the 𝐿𝐴 noise metric, calculated
(cid:4958)(cid:4970)
as [85]:

alltheaircraftinascenario,indB(A).Thecomputationof𝐿𝐴(𝑡)usesnoise-power-
distance relations that are similar to those found in environmental noise prediction
programs such as the Integrated Noise Model (INM) ) [86]. These relations (not
shown) were established based on the data that is available for PAVs currently
being designed, including the Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) and FAA regu-
lations governing the maximum noise that is allowed to be generated by tilt-rotor
aircraft.

The footprints of the 𝐿𝐴 metric are assessed by calculating iso-contour lines at
(cid:4958)(cid:4970)
the 68 dB(A) level. Although noise regulations in the Netherlands are based on
the48and58dB(A)LoudnessDayEveningNight(LDEN)soundlevels,norequire-
ments have been specified for the large amount of PAV traffic considered in this
work. Hence, the next level, 68 dB(A), was selected for the current analysis. The 2
encapsulated area of this contour can be used to compare concepts. A larger con-
tour area implies a larger exposure to noise pollution. More details on the noise
modeling method used in this work can be found in [87].
2.4. Results
In this section, the results of the nominal and non-nominal experiments are pre-
sented separately. For both experiments, the effect of the independent variables
(airspace concept and traffic demand/number of rogue aircraft) on the dependent
measures is analyzed using error bar charts, displaying the mean and the 95%
confidence interval for each simulation condition. As identical scenarios were per-
formed with and without tactical CR, whenever relevant, separate error bar charts
areusedtoassesstheneedandtheeffectofCRonthefourconcepts. Thesecharts
are created by consolidating the demand data per concept.
2.4.1. Nominal Experiment
More than six million individual flights were simulated during the nominal experi-
ment. Of these, data from approximately three million flights that flew during the
logging hour have been analyzed. To gain a better sense on the amount of traf-
fic simulated, as well as to explain the consequent implications on the analysis of
the dependent variables, it is first necessary to consider the traffic volumes and
densities that were actually realized during the experiment.
2.4.1.1. Traffic Volume and Density
Figure 2.7(a) shows the total traffic volume simulated during the logging hour, per
simulation run, for all concept-demand combinations. Here it can be seen that the
traffic volume simulated for the Full Mix, Layers and Zones concepts are the same
and range from 12,000 aircraft in the Low scenario, to 22,000 aircraft in the Ultra
scenario. Ontheotherhand,theTubesconceptisshowntodeviatefromtheother
concepts for all demand conditions, even though all concepts were subjected to
the same scenarios. In fact, the maximum traffic volume achieved by the Tubes
concept in the Ultra scenario is less than the Medium demand volume realized by
the three less structured concepts, indicating that demand could not be met by
Tubes. This is because the Tubes concept used pre-departure delays and flight
cancellationswheneverconflictfreeroutescouldnotbefoundatscenariospecified
departuretimes. Asotherconceptsdidnothavetheabilitytodelayorcancelflights,
all flights in the demand scenarios were simulated.

In addition to total volume, it is also necessary to consider the traffic densities
realizedduringthesimulation,seeFigure2.7(b). Hereitisclearthattrafficdensity
isfairlysimilarfortheFullMix,LayersandZonesconceptsforalldemandconditions.
Conversely, the Tubes concept resulted in the highest traffic densities, despite the
lowernumberofflightssimulatedforalldemandscenarios(compareFigure2.7(a)
withFigure2.7(b)). Thisparadoxicalresultcanbeexplainedbythefactthataircraft
in the Tubes concept were often forced to use indirect and longer routes when the
shortest path between an origin-destination pair was congested i.e., not conflict
free prior to departure. Thus, average distances were much higher for Tubes (see
efficiency metrics), causing aircraft to exist for longer durations in the experiment
volume, which in turn resulted in higher densities than the other concepts.
These differences in traffic volume and density for the Tubes concept need to be
taken into account when considering the other dependent variables. Although Fig-
ure 2.7(a) suggests that Tubes has a lower airspace capacity when compared to
theotherconcepts,itshouldbenotedthatthefiguredoesnotimplythattheother
concepts are able to, for instance, facilitate the higher volumes safely. Therefore,
conclusionswithrespecttocapacityalsodependontheotherdependentvariables
discussed below, and cannot be based purely on the amount of traffic simulated.
Moreover, whenever appropriate, these metrics are computed relative to the num-
ber of flights simulated to allow for a fair comparison between concepts.
2.4.1.2. Safety
The number of conflicts and intrusions per flight for all simulation conditions are
displayedinFigures2.8and2.9,respectively. Asexpected,thenumberofconflicts
and intrusions increased with traffic demand for all concepts, see Figures 2.8(a)
and 2.9(a). Furthermore, the figures also show that the more structured Zones
and Tubes concepts led to significantly higher numbers of conflicts and intrusions
compared to the less structured Full Mix and Layers concepts.

The effect of tactical CR on the number of conflicts and intrusions is pictured in
Figures 2.8(b) and 2.9(b), respectively. Here, the results with CR ON reflect the
safetyofeachconceptasawhole,whereastheresultswithCROFFshowshowwell

CR, there were no differences between the ON and OFF conditions. For the other
three concepts, the number of intrusions was considerably reduced with CR ON.
However,theeffectofCRonthenumberofconflictsdidnotfollowthesametrend.
For Full Mix and Zones, the number of conflicts increased with CR ON. This was
expected, as resolution maneuvers increase flight distances and the consequent
probability of encountering other aircraft. However, for the Layers concept, the
oppositewasfound,withCRONleadingtoalowernumberofconflicts. Thisunusual
result is further analyzed using stability metrics.

scenarios. This was because the trajectory planning functions used in the Tubes

As no tactical CR was used in the Tubes concept, these conflicts also resulted in a
large number of intrusions.

To further analyze trends in the number of safety incidents, the relative velocity
magnitudes between conflicting aircraft is computed, see Figure 2.10. Here, only
conflicts between cruising aircraft, and data for simulations with CR OFF,areused,
inordertoconsidertheinherentsafetyofeachconcept. Fromthisfigure,itisclear
that the vertical airspace segmentation used by the Layers concept significantly
reduced relative velocities compared to the other three concepts, explaining the
high safety of this concept.

The effect of the independent variables on intrusion severity is pictured in Fig-
ure 2.11. Here it can be seen that the Zones concept resulted in the lowest intru-
sion severity, despite experiencing the highest number of conflicts and intrusions.
Furthermore,thefigureshowsthatintrusionseverityisnotsignificantlydependent
on traffic demand. This suggests that intrusion severity is more a function of the
selectedCRalgorithmthanairspacestructure. Duetotheresolutionmaneuversini-
tiated by the MVP algorithm, intrusion severity was reduced when CR was enabled
for Full Mix, Layers and Zones, see Figure 2.11(b).
Figure2.12showstheresultsfortheIntrusionPreventionRate(IPR)metric,which
measures the ability of a concept to solve conflicts without causing intrusions. For
Full Mix, Layers and Zones, Figure 2.12(a) shows that IPR increases with traffic
demand, while the rate of change of the metric appears to decrease with traffic
demand and increasing airspace structure. This is because the rate of increase of
intrusion number with traffic demand is less than that of conflict number, and the
difference between the rates of change of conflicts and intrusions decreases with
increasing demand and structure, compare Figures 2.8(a) and 2.9(a).
More interestingly, Figure 2.12(b) shows that IPR is non-zero for all concepts with
CR OFF. These conflicts, termed ‘false conflicts’ as they were resolved without in-
tervention from the tactical CR algorithm, were likely to have been caused by the
state based CD method used in this work. As this CD implementation relied on

2.4.1.3. Efficiency
Efficiency, measured using the work done metric, is shown in Figure 2.13. Here,
a positive correlation between work done, level of airspace structure and traffic
demand can be seen. The Full Mix concept displays the lowest work done, and is

closelyfollowedbytheLayersconcept. Thedifferencebetweenthesetwoconcepts
canbetracedbacktotheinefficientaltitudesusedbytheLayersconcept,whereas
Full Mix used the most optimum horizontal and vertical flight paths to improve
efficiency. The Tubes concept led to the highest work done, implying that aircraft
flew significantly longer distances in this concept. For the Full Mix, Layers and
Zones concepts, work done was found to be higher with CR ON due to the extra
distanceflownduringtacticalCRmaneuvers,seeFigure2.13(b). Thesetrendswere
also seen when comparing the distance traveled between concepts (not shown).
Thus,theresultsstronglyindicatethatefficiencydecreaseswithincreasingairspace

The stability of the airspace as result a of CR maneuvers is measured using the
Domino Effect Parameter (DEP). A negative DEP implies a net stabilizing effect of
tacticalCRwherebyconflictchainreactionsareoutweighedbythosethataresolved

the opposite, with conflict chain reactions causing airspace instability. The DEP for
all concept-scenario combinations is pictured in Figure 2.14. Note that the DEP is
consistentlyzeroforTubesasitdidnotusetacticalCR.Fortheotherthreeconcepts,
the DEP for the Low demand scenario is similar and negative. However at higher
demand levels, the DEP increases to positive values for the Full Mix and Zones
concepts. This suggests that the maneuvering room available to solve conflicts
decreases rapidly with increasing airspace density for these two concepts, making
it progressively more difficult to avoid intrusions without triggering additional con-
flicts. ThisisparticularlytruefortheZonesconceptwhichexperiencedaverylarge

Although the DEP also increased with demand for Layers, it remained negative
for the range of densities considered in this work, see Figure 2.14. This suggests
that the vertical segmentation of traffic used by the Layers concept is more able
to prevent conflict propagation from occurring, and is better at assisting the MVP
CR algorithm in solving the conflicts that do occur by reducing conflict angles and
relative velocities between aircraft cruising at the same altitude, i.e., through the
alignment of neighboring traffic. This result explains the reduction in the number
of conflicts with CR ON, noted earlier for Layers (see Figure 2.8).

The number of consecutive arrivals with a time interval smaller than 60 seconds
(equaling the CD look-ahead time), per destination, is shown in Figure 2.15(a).
This figure shows that the Tubes concept violated the 60 second threshold the
least. This suggests that the time based separation used to separate traffic in the

is partly due to the higher traffic volumes handled by these concepts, this result
shows that some form of arrival metering may be necessary for Full Mix, Layers
and Zones. But, as the average arrival interval between aircraft is always greater
than 300 seconds for these three concepts, see Figure 2.15(b), arrival sequenc-
ing can likely be managed by varying the speeds of conflicting aircraft during the
final descent. Given the high average arrival intervals for all concepts, the differ-

2.4.1.6. Structural Complexity
Figure2.16displaystheresultsfortheStructuralComplexity(𝑆𝐶𝑋)metric,normal-
ized with respect to the total number of flights simulated per concept. Here, high
values corresponds to traffic situations that are more difficult to control, and those
thataremoresensitivetouncertainties. Figure 2.16(a)showsthat 𝑆𝐶𝑋 followeda
similar trend to the number of conflicts and intrusions, with a clear distinction be-
tween the two less structured concepts, which display a linear growth of 𝑆𝐶𝑋 with
demand,whencomparedtothetwomorestructuredconcepts,whichresultedina
quadratic increase of 𝑆𝐶𝑋 with demand. This strongly suggests that little structur-
ing of airspace, as used by Full Mix and Layers, results in traffic patterns that are
easier to control than those produced by the predetermined routes of the Zones
and Tubes concepts.

The pre-planned routes used by the Tubes concept were expected to result in the
lowest complexity. In fact, the absolute 𝑆𝐶𝑋 values were the lowest for Tubes.
However, when the results were normalized, the contribution of each flight to 𝑆𝐶𝑋
wasfoundtobemuchhigherforTubesthanfortheotherconcepts. Thehighcom-
plexityoftheZonesconceptcanbetracedtotrafficconvergenceattheintersections

𝑆𝐶𝑋metricconsidersallpossibletrajectoryrealizations/evolutionsbetweenaircraft

the 𝑆𝐶𝑋 metric is not suitable to analyze the effect of CR maneuvers on intrinsic
complexity.
To gain more insight on the effect of CR on complexity, the influence of CR ma-
neuvers on the general complexity metric, described by eq. 2.5, is displayed in
Figure 2.17. Here, it can be seen that CR ON reduced the general complexity met-
ric for the Full Mix, Layers and Zones concepts, indicating that CR improves the
controllability of a given traffic situation, as expected.

2.5. Discussion
Inthischapter,fouren-routeairspaceconceptsofincreasingstructure,namedFull
Mix, Layers, Zones and Tubes, were compared using two fast-time simulation ex-
periments that involved over eleven million flights. These simulations focused on
the degree of structuring needed to maximize capacity for decentralized separa-
tion,andinvestigatedwhethertheoptimalmodeofstructuringdependedontraffic
density. The simulations also studied the robustness of the different structuring
methods to non-nominal events. Here, capacity was inferred from the effect of
multiple traffic demand scenarios on safety, efficiency, stability, arrival sequencing,
structural complexity and noise pollution metrics, while robustness was assessed
fromtheinfluenceofincreasingnumbersofrogueaircraftonsafetymetrics.
As indicated previously, the goal of this work is not to propose an operationally
readyairspacedesign,buttofocusonhowthelevelofstructuringaffectsairspace
capacity for decentralization. In relation to this specific goal, and considering the
results of all metrics in unison, it can be concluded that some limited structure in
the vertical dimension, as demonstrated by the Layers concept, can be beneficial
in terms of capacity. This is because traffic demand, in addition to varying in time,
displays no predominant patterns in the horizontal dimension for decentralization.
Therefore,astricthorizontalstructuringofairspacecancauseamismatchbetween
the imposed structure and the demand pattern, as for the Zones and Tubes con-
cepts. This in turn caused artificial bottlenecks at the intersection points of their
predefined topologies, reducing overall performance. On the other hand, the ver-
tical airspace segmentation used by the Layers concept dispersed traffic vertically,
and grouped traffic by similarity of travel direction. This reduced the chance of

conflictsbyloweringrelativevelocitiesbetweencruisingaircraftwhencomparedto
the completely unstructured Full Mix concept, without unduly affecting efficiency,

possible with Layers. These conclusions were not expected as previous research
2 had focused primarily on either fully structured or fully unstructured airspace de-
signs.
Fortherangeofdensitiesconsideredinthiswork,theresultsofthenominalsimula-
tionsalsoindicatethattheoptimummethodofstructuringisindependentoftraffic
density. Infact,theresultsshowacleardistinctionbetweenthetwolessstructured
and the two more structured concepts; while performance degraded with increas-
ing density for all concepts, it did so at a much higher rate for Zones and Tubes.
In particular, the safety of the Zones and Tubes concepts deteriorated rapidly for
the higher densities, indicating that the airspace had become saturated for these
twohighlystructuredconcepts. Whenconsideringthefactthatrouteplanningwas
morecomputationallyintensiveforZonesandTubes,theadditionalconstraintsim-
posed on traffic by these two concepts did not translate into benefits in terms of
capacity.
The clear distinction between the two more and two less structured concepts was
not, however, found for the results of the non-nominal simulations. In that exper-
iment, the safety of the Full Mix, Layers and Zones concepts was not significantly
affectedbyrogueaircraft. Thissuggeststhattacticalconflictresolution,whichwas
usednativelybythesethreeconceptstoresolveconflictsbetweennominalaircraft,
could also effectively compensate for non-cooperative aircraft, without adversely
affecting capacity. This was not the case for the Tubes concept. Here, the un-
certainties caused by rogue aircraft made it difficult for nominal aircraft to adhere
to time constraints at waypoints along a route. The resulting break down of the
pre-planned space-time routes used by Tubes to separate aircraft caused a large
numberofunintendedconflictsandintrusions. TheperformanceofTubeswasalso
affectedbywindforthesamereason. Whileallconceptswerenegativelyinfluenced
by uncertainties, the current results show that the safety of highly structured and
planned airspace concepts is particularly vulnerable to variations between the in-
tended and actual flight trajectories.
Formanymetrics,theFullMixandLayersconceptsexhibitedverysimilarbehavior.
Thesimilaritybetweenthesetwoconceptswashighlightedbytheirnoisefootprints,
which were indistinguishable. The only difference between these two concepts is
the method of altitude selection; aircraft in Full Mix used the most fuel-efficient
altitude,whileforLayers,altitudewasdependentonthedirectiontothedestination.
Therefore, Full Mix was expected, and was also found, to be slightly more energy
efficient. However, the similarity in efficiency between these two concepts may be
aresultoftheshortcruisingdistancesusedinthiswork,andlongerdistancesmay
further increase the efficiency differences between Full Mix and Layers.
Although the vertical structuring used by Layers reduced efficiency relative to the
unstructured Full Mix concept, it led to the highest stability of all four structuring

It is hypothesized that a negative DEP is caused by the alignment of neighboring
traffic,andtheconsequentreductionofrelativevelocitiesthataidsCRperformance,

also found for Full Mix and Zones at low demand levels, at higher densities, these
modesofstructuringtransitionedtopositiveDEPvales,indicatingagreaterdegra-
dation of airspace stability with density. Hence, the stability analysis indicates that
the altitude constraints utilized by Layers can accommodate even higher densities
than what was considered in this work, without significantly reducing safety or ef-
ficiency. This reiterates the notion that a limited degree of vertical structuring can
be beneficial for the capacity and robustness of decentralized airspace.
It should be noted that the results of this study are, to some degree, sensitive
to the specific parameter settings selected for the concepts. However, given the
magnitude of the differences in all of the results, as well as the consistency be-
tweenresults,itisunlikelythattheoveralltrendsareaffectedbydifferentsettings;
capacity for decentralization was found to improve when structural constraints did
not affect the horizontal path of aircraft. This conclusion is most applicable for
traffic scenarios without any distinct horizontal patterns. For traffic demand cases
withdiscerniblehorizontalpatterns,suchasforcurrenthub-and-spokeoperations,
airspace concepts that permit flexible routing in the horizontal direction are also
expected to perform well, as such structuring would not conflict with any demand
pattern. Nonetheless,itmaybepossibletotailorthetopologiesofmorestructured
concepts to match such scenarios.
2.6. Conclusions
This work investigated the degree of structuring needed to maximize capacity for
decentralized en-route airspace. To this end, four decentralized en-route airspace
concepts of increasing structure were compared using fast-time simulations. For
the studied densities, the following conclusions can be drawn:

3.1. Introduction 63
To overcome the capacity limitations posed by airway routing, some researchers
have proposed a transition to less rigid route structures for en route airspace [30,
33, 91–93]. This approach has been adopted in some low-density areas of Europe
with the creation of so called ‘Free Route Airspaces’ (FRAs) since 2008 [94]. FRAs
aimtoemulatetherouteselectionflexibilityofferedtoaircraftflyinginunmanaged
airspace, while continuing to provide air traffic controllers with control of the traf-
fic within them. Analysis by Eurocontrol has shown that the limited use of FRAs
thus far has yielded an average route efficiency increase of 1.6% per flight, with
gains of up to 4% in some areas [12]. Further extending FRAs into more dense 3
airspace sectors could, therefore, lead to substantial reductions in total delay, fuel
consumption and emissions. As such, FRAs demonstrate the potential of utilizing
procedural mechanisms to reorganize and improve the performance of en route
airspace operations, without large capital investments in new hardware.
While reducing structural constraints can increase en route airspace capacity rela-
tive to airway routing for current traffic demand levels, a recent study has found
that offering operators completefreedom in path planning is not optimal in terms
of safety for higher densities [74]. In that study, several unmanaged en route
airspace concepts, which varied in terms of the number of constrained degrees
of motion, were compared qualitatively using simulation experiments. The results
clearly showed that a layered airspace concept, which used a vertical segmenta-
tion of airspace to separate traffic with different travel directions at different flight
levels, led to the highest safety. The increased safety for ‘layers’ was found to
be a result of the reduction of relative velocities between cruising aircraft at the
same altitude, which in turn reduced the number of conflicts when compared to a
completely unstructured airspace design.
Usingthequalitativeunderstandinggainedfrom[74]asastartingpoint,thischap-
ter aims to develop quantitative models that describe the intrinsic safety provided
byunstructuredandlayeredenrouteairspacedesigns. Herethenotionofintrinsic
safety refers to the ability of an airspace design to reduce the occurrence of con-
flicts due to the constraints that it imposes on traffic motion. As such, the intrinsic
safetyprovidedbyanairspacedesignisirrespectiveofwhetherornotconflictsare
actuallydetectedbyaircraft;insteadthisaspectofsafetyconsiderstheeffectofthe
route structure imposed by a particular design on the number of ‘truly occurring’
conflicts. Consequently, intrinsic safety is directly proportional to the workload ex-
periencedbypilotsand/orairtrafficcontrollersinresolvinganyremainingconflicts
that could not be prevented by a particular airspace design.
The modeling approach used in this work treats aircraft conflicts similar to the
collisionsthatoccurbetweenidealgasparticlestodetermineinstantaneoussystem-
wide conflict counts as a measure of intrinsic safety. In comparison to previous
studies, the models considered here take into account the effect of the horizontal
andthe vertical motion of aircraft on conflict counts. This is done by grouping the
considered aircraft according to flight phase, while also considering the proportion
ofaircraftindifferentflightphases. Thisapproachallowsconflictsinvolvingclimbing
anddescendingtraffic,aswellasthosebetweenaircraft,tobetakenintoaccount.

Becausetheresultingthree-dimensionalanalyticalmodelsusemeasurableairspace
characteristics,suchastrafficdemandandseparationrequirements,asinputs,they
lend themselves well for airspace design applications as the interactions between
the factors affecting safety can be directly understood from the structure of the
models.
To assess the accuracy of the derived models, three separate fast-time simulation
experimentshavebeenperformed,encompassingalmostthreemillionflights. The
first experiment measures the accuracy of the models under ideal conditions, and

during the derivation process regarding the speed distributions of aircraft.
This chapter begins with an outline of the relevant background material and an
overview of previous research in section 3.2. Next, in sections 3.3 and 3.4, the
derivationofthemodelsispresented. Thisisfollowedbythedesignofthesimula-
tion experiments used to assess model accuracy in section 3.5. Simulation results
are presented in section 3.6, and discussed in section 3.7. Finally, a summary of
the main conclusions is given in section 3.8.
3.2. Background
This section summarizes the background material needed to follow the conflict
count model derivations developed in this chapter. The sections begins by dis-
cussing the relationship between conflicts and intrinsic airspace safety. Addition-
ally, descriptions of the conceptual design of unstructured and layered airspace
concepts, as well as a review of previous studies that have used analytical models
to measure intrinsic airspace safety, are provided.
3.2.1. Conflicts,IntrusionsandIntrinsicAirspaceSafety
Safety in ATM is often measured in terms of the number of intrusions and con-
flicts. Here, intrusions, also known as losses of separation, occur when minimum
separation requirements are violated. Conflicts, on the other hand, are defined as
predictedintrusions;theyoccurwhenthehorizontalandverticaldistancesbetween
aircraft are expected to be less than the prescribed separation standards within a
predetermined ‘look-ahead’ time. Therefore, when a conflict occurs, some action
needs to be taken by pilots and/or air traffic controllers to prevent that conflict
fromturningintoanintrusioninthefuture. Thedistinctionbetweenintrusionsand
conflicts is illustrated in Figure 3.1.
Although a conflict is strictly speaking only defined between two aircraft, they can
also occur between with more aircraft at the same time. Such ‘multi-aircraft’ con-
flicts can still be treated as several two-aircraft conflicts and are included in the

aircraft conflict involving four aircraft can result in uptosix unique two-aircraft
conflicts; see Figure 3.2. This combinatorial property is used by the modeling ap-

Asmentionedearlier,thisworkfocusesonmodelingtheintrinsicsafetyofunstruc-

the safety that is provided by the constraints imposed on aircraft motion by an
airspacedesign. Sincethetypeandnumberofconstraintsimposeddirectlyaffects
theprobabilityofintersectingtrajectories,theintrinsicsafetyofanairspacedesign
can be measured in terms of the number of conflicts that occur at any given mo-
mentintime,i.e.,bythenumberofinstantaneousconflicts. Althoughmeasurement
andcommunicationuncertaintiescanaffectthenumberofobserved,orperceived,
conflicts for particular a aircraft, such uncertainties are unrelated to the design of
an airspace. As such, the intrinsic safety provided by an airspace design is only
concerned with the ‘truly occurring’ conflicts in an airspace.

cussed in this chapter to be applied to current commercial air traffic operations, as
wellasforfutureoperationsintegratingunmannedaircraftwithautomateddetect-
and-avoid systems.
3.2.2. Unstructured Airspace
As the name suggests, no constraints are imposed on aircraft motion in Unstruc-
3 turedAirspace(UA).Instead,thissimplestformofairspacedesignfocusesonmaxi-
mizingoverallsystemefficiency. Therefore,aircraftarefreetousedirecthorizontal
routes,aslongassuchroutingisnotobstructedbyweatherorstaticobstacles. Sim-
ilarly, aircraft can also fly with preferred speeds and at optimum altitudes, based
on their performance capabilities and trip distances. By offering greater freedom
to aircraft operators, UA has been found to result in a more uniform distribution of
traffic, both horizontally and vertically, reducing traffic concentrations and ensuing
delays [29, 30].
3.2.3. Layered Airspace
Several different layered airspace concepts have been discussed in literature [95–
97]. The specific variation under consideration in this work was developed in our
prior work [74], and is known as the ‘Layers’ concept.
The Layers concept can be seen as an extension to the hemispheric/semicircular
rule [79]. In this concept, the airspace is segmented into vertically stacked bands,
and heading-altitude rules are used to limit the range of travel directions allowed
in each altitude layer. Although the Layers concept dictates the vertical profile of a
flight,operatorsarefreetoselectdirecthorizontalrouteswhenpossible. Moreover,
climbing and descending aircraft are exempted from the heading-altitude rules,
and can violate them to reach their cruising altitude or destination. This exception
avoids inefficient ‘spirals’ when climbing/descending.
An example Layers concept is shown in Figure 3.3. Two parameters define the
topologyoftheLayersconcept. Thefirstparameteristhespacingbetweenaltitude
bands,𝜁. Animportantdesignrequirementisthat𝜁 isatleastequaltothevertical
separation requirement to prevent conflicts between aircraft cruising in adjacent
flight levels. In this work, a vertical separation requirement of 1000 ft is used.
Therefore,thealtitudebandsoftheLayersconceptsconsideredhereareseparated
by𝜁 =1100ft;theextra100ftisusedtopreventsocalled‘false’conflictsthatcan
sometimes occur due to any slight overshooting of altitude when aircraft level-off
at their desired flight level. Such an offset is also necessary to account for any
height-keeping errors, and because of turbulence.
The second design parameter of the Layers concept is the heading range allowed
per altitude band, 𝛼. For the layered airspace shown in Figure 3.3, 𝛼 = 45(cid:4968), and
thus eight flight levels are needed to define one complete ‘set’ of layers. Corre-

spondingly, for a layered design with 𝛼 = 90(cid:4968), only four flight levels would be
needed to specify all possible travel directions. Therefore, for 𝛼 = 90(cid:4968), two com-
plete ‘sets’ of layers would fit within the volume of airspace needed for 𝛼 = 45(cid:4968).
When multiple sets of layers are available, the total trip distance of an aircraft is
used in addition to its heading to determine its cruising altitude. In this way, short
flights can use lower layer sets, and longer flights can use higher layer sets, to
reduce the negative effect of predetermined altitudes on flight efficiencies.
3.2.4. Previous Research on Conflict Count Modeling
Tomodelthetotalnumberofinstantaneousconflictsinagivenvolumeofairspace,
it is necessary to take into account the total number of possible interactions be-
tween aircraft in that airspace, i.e., the maximum number of unique, two-aircraft
combinations. Since any conflict can be decomposed into a series of one or more
two-aircraft conflicts, see section 3.2.1, the maximum number of instantaneous
conflicts possible is equal to the total number of unique two-aircraft combinations.
However,inpractice,notallaircraftarelikelytobeinconflictatthesametimebe-

ever, as most previous studies have only considered interactions between cruising
aircraft, they have only presented models for the horizontal component of the ex-

traffic, they have done so by assuming a uniform distribution of flight-path angles,
without adequate explanations for the distribution shape or the range of values
selected [68, 69]. Moreover, a uniform distribution of flight-path angles is not a
reasonableassumptionforenrouteairspacedesign,thefocusofthischapter. This
is particularly the case for layered airspace designs which require aircraft to main-
tain fixed altitudes while cruising, see section 3.2.3. Consequently, the distribution
of flight-path angles can be skewed, and depends on the proportion of aircraft in
different flight phases.
Building on our earlier work [70], this chapter extends previous research on con-
flict count modeling, by developing analytical models for both the horizontal and
vertical components of the expected relative velocity. While the derivation of the

3.3. Modeling Conflict Probability
Thegoalofthissectionistoderiveconflictprobabilityexpressionsfordirect-routing
airspace concepts, such as unstructured and layered airspace designs, as a func- 3
tion of conflict detection parameters. Here, the conflict probability of an airspace
design is defined as the likelihood that two randomly selected aircraft are in con-
flict,i.e.,thelikelihoodthatthetrajectoriesoftwoarbitraryaircraftarepredictedto
becloser than the prescribedseparationrequirementswithinthe conflict detection
look-ahead time. Although the main contribution of this study is on the develop-
ment of 3D conflict probability models, this section begins by considering the 2D
case. This is because the 2D model is directly required to estimate conflict counts
between cruising aircraft in layered airspaces. The 3D model is subsequently de-
rived as an extension of the 2D case.
3.3.1. Conflict Probability for 2D Airspace
In 2D airspace, aircraft motion is restricted to the horizontal plane. Thus, aircraft
velocitiesarepurelyhorizontal,andallconflictsarebetweencruisingaircraft.
Previous studies have proposed that the conflict probability between any two air-
craft in 2D airspace, 𝑝 , can be computed by comparing the instantaneous area
(cid:4796)(cid:4957)
searchedfor conflicts by an aircraft, 𝐴 , to the totalairspaceareaunder consid-
(cid:4956)
eration, 𝐴 ; see Figure 3.4. Here it can be seen that 𝐴 is approximated as a
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965) (cid:4956)
rectangular ‘conflict search area’, and its size is defined by the conflict detection
look-ahead time, 𝑡 , the horizontal separation requirement, 𝑆 , and the expected
(cid:4965) (cid:4961)
horizontal relative velocity between aircraft, E(𝑉 ). Since a conflict is detected
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
if the trajectory of another aircraft is predicted to pass through 𝐴 , 𝑝 can be

(cid:4796)(cid:4957) (cid:4971),(cid:4961)
Because the goal of the derivation process is to determine the average conflict
probability between a population of aircraft for a given airspace design, and not
just between two specific flights, the expectedhorizontal relative velocity is used.
More specifically, E(𝑉 ) can be thought of as the weighted average of the hor-

izontal relative velocities between allaircraft pairs (not just the conflicting pairs),
giventheaircraftspeedandheadingdifferencedistributionsintheairspaceareaof

Nonetheless, to compute E(𝑉 ), it is still useful to first consider the magnitude
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
of the horizontal relative velocity between an arbitrary pair of aircraft, 𝑉 ; see
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
Figure 3.5. Using the cosine rule, 𝑉 can be computed as:
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
(cid:4795)/(cid:4796)
𝑉 =(𝑉(cid:4796)+𝑉(cid:4796)−2𝑉𝑉 cos(Δ𝜓)) (3.3)

Here,𝑉 and𝑉 arethevelocitymagnitudesofthetwoaircraftpicturedinFigure3.5,

it is necessary to integrate equation 3.3 over all possible values of velocity and

In the above equation, 𝛼 represents the maximum possible heading difference be-
tween any two cruising aircraft. Due to the complexity of equation 3.4, it can only
be solvednumerically [69]. However, an analytical solution is possible if all aircraft
areassumedtohaveequalvelocitymagnitudes,i.e.,if𝑉 =𝑉 =𝑉. Underthisas-

|Δ𝜓|

𝑉 =2 𝑉 sin( ) (3.5)
(cid:4971),(cid:4961) (cid:4968) 2
Since 𝑉 is assumed to be a constant, the above simplified equation shows that
(cid:4968)
𝑉 is only dependent on the absolute heading difference between two aircraft,
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
|Δ𝜓|. Therefore a simplified analytical expression for E(𝑉 ) can be derived by

3.3.2. Conflict Probability for 3D Airspace
In 3D en route airspace, cruising aircraft share the airspace with climbing and de-
scending aircraft. Therefore in 3D, conflicts can occur between aircraft in different
flight phases. Moreover, aircraft can have horizontal, as well as vertical velocity
components.
Analogous to the two-dimensional case, for 3D airspace, conflict probability can
be defined as the ratio between the instantaneous volumeof airspace searched
3 forconflicts, 𝐵 , andthe totalairspacevolumeunderconsideration𝐵 ; seeFig-

(cid:4975) (cid:4971)
It can be shown that volume 𝐵 can be decomposed into two orthogonal compo-

To fully quantify 𝑝 , it is necessary to develop analytical formulations for the ex-
(cid:4797)(cid:4957)
pectedhorizontalandverticalrelativevelocities. Thisisdoneinthefollowingpara-
graphs.
3.3.2.1. Expected Horizontal Relative Velocity
To model the expected horizontal relative velocity in an airspace, E(𝑉 ), it is first
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
necessarytoproperlydefinewhatismeantasthe‘horizontalvelocity’ofanaircraft,
𝑉 (cid:4961) ;seeFigure3.7. Thisfigureshowsthat𝑉 (cid:4961) isafunctionoftheofthetotalvelocity 3

itsverticalvelocity,(cid:4949).
(cid:5223)
𝑉 =𝑉cos(𝛾) (3.9)
(cid:4961)
As indicated previously, this chapter is concerned with modeling conflict counts for
enrouteairspace. Inenrouteairspace,aircraftgenerallyclimb/descendwithflight-
path angles less than six degrees. Based on the above equation, for such small
angles, 𝑉 ≈ 𝑉. Therefore 𝛾 does notsignificantly affect 𝑉 in en route airspace.
(cid:4961) (cid:4961)
Forthisreason,𝑉 andE(𝑉 )canalsobeconsideredtobeindependentof𝛾inen
(cid:4971),(cid:4961) (cid:4971),(cid:4961)
route airspace. Thus, the expression for E(𝑉 ) developed earlier for 2D en route
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
airspace, given by equation 3.7, can also be used for 3D en route airspace.
It is important to note that the approach presented here to model E(𝑉 ) is only
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
applicable forsmall flight-pathangles, as isthecase inenrouteairspaces. Forthe
rarecaseswhere𝛾 >>10(cid:4968),itwouldbenecessarytotake𝛾intoaccountwhencom-
puting E(𝑉 ). This would require a rewriting of equations 3.4 and 3.7 to include
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
an additional integral that considers the probability density of 𝛾 when modeling
E(𝑉 ). However,asshownbythehighmodelaccuracyresultsinsection3.6,this
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
added complexity is generally not required.
3.3.2.2. Expected Vertical Relative Velocity
Followingasimilarproceduretothehorizontaldirection,itisusefultofirstdefinethe
vertical velocity of an individual aircraft, 𝑉. Using Figure 3.7, 𝑉 can be computed
(cid:4975) (cid:4975)
as:
𝑉 =𝑉sin(𝛾) (3.10)
(cid:4975)

--- Page 93 ---

74 3. Three-Dimensional Analytical Conflict Count Models
Forsmallvaluesof𝛾,asforenrouteairspace,theaboveequationcanbesimplified
as𝑉 ≈𝑉𝛾. Therefore,unlikethehorizontalcase,𝑉 isdependenton𝛾. Ifallaircraft
(cid:4975) (cid:4975)
are assumed to have equal total velocities, i.e., if 𝑉 = 𝑉, then the magnitude of
(cid:4968)
theverticalrelativevelocitybetweentwoarbitraryaircraft,𝑉 ,isdependentonthe
(cid:4971),(cid:4975)
flight path angles of each aircraft, 𝛾 and 𝛾 :
(cid:4795) (cid:4796)
𝑉 =|𝑉 sin(𝛾 )−𝑉 sin(𝛾 )| (3.11)
(cid:4971),(cid:4975) (cid:4968) (cid:4796) (cid:4968) (cid:4795)
3
Because the values of 𝛾 and 𝛾 can be different for every aircraft pair, to com-
(cid:4795) (cid:4796)
pute the expected vertical relative velocity, E(𝑉 ), it is necessary to integrate
(cid:4971),(cid:4975)
equation 3.11 for all possible values of 𝛾 and 𝛾 , while taking into account the
(cid:4795) (cid:4796)
probability density function of the flight path angles of each aircraft, 𝑃(𝛾 ) and
(cid:4795)
𝑃(𝛾 ):
(cid:4796)
E(𝑉 )=∫ ∫ |𝑉 sin(𝛾 )−𝑉 sin(𝛾 )| 𝑃(𝛾 )𝑃(𝛾 ) 𝑑𝛾 𝑑𝛾 (3.12)
(cid:4971),(cid:4975) (cid:4968) (cid:4796) (cid:4968) (cid:4795) (cid:4795) (cid:4796) (cid:4795) (cid:4796)
(cid:5008)(cid:5043) (cid:5008)(cid:5044)
To develop an analytical model for E(𝑉 ), the following simplification is made
(cid:4971),(cid:4975)
in this chapter. In en route airspace, an aircraft can be considered to be either
cruising or climbing or descending. Cruising aircraft generally fly with 𝛾 ≈0(cid:4968).
(cid:4956)(cid:4971)(cid:4974)(cid:4962)(cid:4972)(cid:4958)
Furthermore, it is reasonable to assume a constant and equal |𝛾| for all climbing
and descending aircraft. Therefore, it is assumed that 𝛾 takes one of the following
three values in en route airspace:
0 for cruising aircraft
𝛾 ={+𝛾 for climbing aircraft (3.13)
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)
−𝛾 for descending aircraft
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)
Using the above simplification, it is possible to rewrite equation 3.12 into its dis-
cretized form:
E(𝑉 )=∑∑|𝑉 sin(𝛾 )−𝑉 sin(𝛾 )| 𝑃(𝛾 )𝑃(𝛾 ) (3.14)
(cid:4971),(cid:4975) (cid:4968) (cid:4796) (cid:4968) (cid:4795) (cid:4795) (cid:4796)
(cid:5008)(cid:5043) (cid:5008)(cid:5044)
To utilize equation 3.14, it is necessary to determine discretized values for 𝑉 and
(cid:4971),(cid:4975)
𝑃(𝛾 ) ⋅ 𝑃(𝛾 ). Discretized values of 𝑉 can be computed by evaluating equa-
(cid:4795) (cid:4796) (cid:4971),(cid:4975)
tion 3.11 for all flight phase combinations of two arbitrary aircraft, see Table 3.1.
This table shows that 𝑉 is zero when both aircraft have the same flight path an-
(cid:4971),(cid:4975)
gle,andthat𝑉 ishighestwhenthetwoaircraftareflyingwithoppositeflightpath
(cid:4971),(cid:4975)
angles, as expected.
Discretizedvaluesfor𝑃(𝛾 )⋅𝑃(𝛾 )canbecomputedbynotingthatthediscretized
(cid:4795) (cid:4796)
probability distribution of 𝛾 is equivalent to the proportion of aircraft in cursing,

3.4. Modeling Conflict Counts
This section presents the derivation of conflict count models for unstructured and
layered airspace concepts. These derivations make use of the 2D and 3D conflict
probability models developed in the previous section, and are adaptations of the
3
generic conflict count model given by equation 3.1.
3.4.1. Unstructured Airspace
Asindicatedbyequation3.1,thenumberofinstantaneousconflictsforUnstructured
Airspace (UA), 𝐶 , can be modeled as the product of two factors, namely the
(cid:4974)(cid:4954)
numberofcombinationsoftwoaircraft, and the conflictprobabilitybetweenany
twoaircraft. BecauseUAimposesnoconstraintsonaircraftmotion,anaircraftcan
conflict with any other aircraft in the airspace, regardless of the flight phase of
either aircraft. Therefore, the total number of combinations of two aircraft can be
expressed using the binomial coefficient, ((cid:4941)(cid:5221)(cid:5216)(cid:5221)(cid:5202)(cid:5213)), leading to the following model
(cid:4796)
structure for 𝐶 :
(cid:4974)(cid:4954)
𝑁 𝑁 (𝑁 −1)
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965) (cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965) (cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965)
𝐶 =( ) 𝑝 = 𝑝 (3.16)
(cid:4974)(cid:4954) 2 (cid:4974)(cid:4954) 2 (cid:4974)(cid:4954)
Here, 𝑁 is the total number of instantaneous aircraft present in the volume
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965)
of airspace under consideration. The conflict probability between any two aircraft,
𝑝 , scales the number of combinations of two aircraft such that only aircraft pairs
(cid:4974)(cid:4954)
that have intersecting trajectories within detection range are counted as conflicts.
A model for conflict probability in 3D airspaces has been derived in section 3.3.2.

Thus for UA, 𝛼 =360(cid:4968) =2𝜋. Substitution of this value into equation 3.7 yields the
following expression for E(𝑉 ) :

ThestructureoftheLayersconceptreducesthenumberofconflictsbetweencruis-
ing aircraft. However, there are no procedural mechanisms to separate cruising
aircraft from climbing and descending traffic. Therefore, the conflict count model
for layered airspaces needs to be split into three distinct parts based on the flight
phase combinations of interacting aircraft:
𝐶 =𝐶 +𝐶 +𝐶 (3.20)
(cid:4965)(cid:4954)(cid:4978) (cid:4956)(cid:4971)(cid:4974)(cid:4962)(cid:4972)(cid:4958) (cid:4956)(cid:4971)(cid:4974)(cid:4962)(cid:4972)(cid:4958)(cid:4805)(cid:4956)(cid:4957) (cid:4956)(cid:4957)
Here, 𝐶 is the number of conflicts between cruising aircraft, 𝐶 is the
(cid:4956)(cid:4971)(cid:4974)(cid:4962)(cid:4972)(cid:4958) (cid:4956)(cid:4971)(cid:4974)(cid:4962)(cid:4972)(cid:4958)(cid:4805)(cid:4956)(cid:4957)
number of conflicts between cruising and climbing/descending aircraft, and 𝐶 is
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)
the number of conflicts between climbing/descending traffic. Each of these three
conflict types are discussed in the paragraphs that follow.

3.4.2.1. Conflicts Between Cruising Aircraft
The number of instantaneous conflicts between cruising aircraft in the Layers con-
cept can be modeled by taking into account the two aspects that differentiate lay-
eredairspacesfromUA;thereductionofthenumberofpossibleconflictpairs,and
the reduction of the relative velocity between cruising aircraft.

probability between cruising aircraft, 𝑝 , is equal for all cruising flight levels.
(cid:4956)(cid:4971)(cid:4974)(cid:4962)(cid:4972)(cid:4958)
Thus, in a single flight level 𝑗, the number of conflicts between cruising aircraft,
𝐶 , can be expressed as:

𝑁 (𝑁 −1)

uniformly distributed, as for the traffic patterns considered in this work. In case of
an uneven distribution of aircraft headings, a uniform vertical distribution of traffic
can still be achieved by assigning multiple flight levels for the heading ranges with
high demand. Using this assumption, equation 3.22 can be simplified to:

From the above equation, it can be concluded that increasing 𝐿 increases the in-
trinsicsafetyofferedbylayeredconceptstocruisingaircraft. Thisisbecausehigher
values of 𝐿 reduce the number of possible combinations of cruising aircraft pairs
that can interact with each other.

3.5. Fast-Time Simulation Design
To test the accuracy of the conflict count models developed in this work, three
fast-time simulation experiments, named the ‘primary experiment’ the ‘flight-path
angleexperiment’andthe‘groundspeedexperiment’,wereperformed. Thissection
describes the design of these three experiments.
3.5.1. Simulation Development
3.5.1.1. Simulation Platform
TheBlueSkyopen-sourceATMsimulatorwasusedasthesimulationplatforminthis
research. ItwasdevelopedattheDelftUniversityofTechnology(TUDelft)usingthe
Pythonprogramminglanguage. BlueSkyhasnumerousfeaturesincludingtheability
tosimulatemorethan5000aircraftsimultaneously,asuiteofconflictdetectionand
resolution algorithms, and extensive data logging functions. A complete overview
of BlueSky is provided in [108].
In order to simulate aircraft performance dynamics, BlueSky uses point-mass Air-
craft Performance Models (APMs) that are similar in structure to Eurocontrol’s well
known Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) models. The main difference between these
two approaches is that BlueSky uses openly available data to quantify the APMS.
To simplify the simulations, all traffic was simulated using a Boeing 744 model.
A full description of the BlueSky APMs, including their validation, can be found
in [109].
BlueSky uses a simulated Flight Management System (FMS) to provide horizontal
and vertical navigation capabilities, as well as for aircraft speed control. Similar to
real aircraft, the simulated FMS tries to fly an aircraft at the requested Calibrated
Airspeed (CAS) or Mach number, if that is within the performance capabilities of
the aircraft type, which is in turn specified in the APMs for different parts of the

flight envelope. Additionally, speed/heading changes occur while respecting the
acceleration capabilities of aircraft.
3.5.1.2. Conflict Detection
In this study, the so called ‘state-based’ conflict detection method was used. This
methodpredictsseparationviolationsbylinearlyextrapolatingaircraftpositionsover
a predefined look-ahead time. Here, a look-ahead time of 5 minutes, as well as
3
separationrequirementsof5nauticalmileshorizontallyand1000ftvertically,were
used.
Asmentionedinsection3.2.4,themodelsderivedinthischapterareconcernedwith
the intrinsic safety provided by unstructured and layered airspace designs. Since
the notion of intrinsic safety focuses on the number of trulyoccurringconflicts as
a function of airspace design, conflict detection was performed assuming perfect
knowledgeofaircraftstates. Forthesamereason,thesimulationswereperformed
without tactical conflict resolutions.
3.5.1.3. Airspace Concepts and Concept Implementation
Unstructured Airspace (UA) and four layered airspace concepts, each with a differ-
entallowedheadingrangeperflightlevel,𝛼,wereusedinthefast-timesimulations.
Table 3.3 displays the properties of the considered airspace concepts, and also in-
dicates which concepts were used in each of the three experiments performed in
this study.

The airspace concepts were implemented into BlueSky by modifying its trajectory
planning functions. While direct horizontal routes were used in both unstructured
and layered airspaces, the method used to determine the cruising altitude of an
aircraft differed between the two airspace designs. For UA, the cruising altitude of
an aircraft, 𝑍 , was directly proportional to its trip distance, 𝐷:
(cid:4974)(cid:4954),(cid:4962) (cid:4962)
𝑍 −𝑍
𝑍 =𝑍 + (cid:4966)(cid:4954)(cid:4977) (cid:4966)(cid:4962)(cid:4967) (𝐷 −𝐷 ) (3.27)

3.5. Fast-Time Simulation Design 83
Here, 𝑍 and 𝑍 are the minimum and maximum altitudes allowed for cruis-
(cid:4966)(cid:4962)(cid:4967) (cid:4966)(cid:4954)(cid:4977)
ing aircraft in the simulation. Comparably, 𝐷 and 𝐷 are the minimum and
(cid:4966)(cid:4962)(cid:4967) (cid:4966)(cid:4954)(cid:4977)
maximum trip distances of aircraft in the simulation. Since traffic scenarios with a
uniformdistributionoftripdistanceswereused,equation3.27resultedinauniform
vertical distribution of traffic.
On the other hand, for the Layers concept, the cruising altitude of an aircraft,
𝑍 ,dependsonbothitsheading,𝜓,anditstripdistance,𝐷,asindicatedbythe
(cid:4965)(cid:4954)(cid:4978),(cid:4962) (cid:4962) (cid:4962)

(cid:4965)(cid:4954)(cid:4978),(cid:4962) (cid:4966)(cid:4962)(cid:4967) 𝐷 −𝐷 𝛼
(cid:4966)(cid:4954)(cid:4977) (cid:4966)(cid:4962)(cid:4967)
Here, 𝛽 is the number of flight levels needed to define one complete set of layers,
and 𝜅 is the number of complete layer sets. These two parameters are defined as
𝛽 = 360(cid:4968)/𝛼 and 𝜅 = 𝐿/𝛽, where 𝐿 is the total number of available flight levels.
Note that the second term of equation 3.28 computes the cruising altitude of an
aircraftasanintegermultipleoftheverticalspacingbetweenflightlevels, 𝜁,using
the the floor operator (‘⌊ ⌋’). For all layered concepts in this study, 𝜁 = 1100 ft
and 𝐿 = 8. Correspondingly, for most layered concepts, 𝜅 > 1; see Table 3.3.
For layered concepts with 𝜅 > 1, equation 3.28 uses trip distances to determine
cruising altitudes such that short flights remain at lower altitudes, while longer
flights use higher layer sets. This property, combined with traffic scenarios with
a uniform distribution of trip distances and travel directions, resulted in a uniform
of distribution of cruising aircraft over the eight predefined flight levels used by all
layered concepts.
ItshouldbenotedthattheonlydifferencebetweentheUAandL360conceptsisthe
use of predefined flight levels for cruising aircraft in L360, while any altitude could
be selected by aircraft in UA. In fact, the L360 concept was specifically included
in the simulations to investigate the effect of using fixed cruising flight levels while
simultaneouslyallowingallpossibleheadingsineachflightlevelonintrinsicairspace

intotwoparts;a‘transitionzone’withaheightof4000ftforclimbinganddescend-
ing traffic, and a ‘cruising zone’ with a height of 7700 ft. The eight predefined
cruising flight levels for layered airspace concepts were within the latter zone (not
shown).
In the horizontal plane, the sector had a square-shaped cross-section of 400 x
400 NM, and was divided into separate ‘simulation’ and ‘experiment’ regions; see

flight phases were not considered. Instead, aircraft entered the simulation at ran-
dom sector entry-points located on the lower boundary of the ‘transition zone’.
Subsequently, they climbed to their assigned altitude in the ‘cruising zone’. The
specific cruising altitude of an aircraft depended on the airspace concept, and can

respectively. At a predetermined distance from their destination (which depended

see Table 3.5 for the values used for each experiment. Furthermore, each aircraft
maintained a constant ground speed during its flight. The speed distribution of
aircraft for the three experiments is listed in Table 3.6.
3.5.2.2. Scenario Generation
A scenario generator was created to produce traffic scenarios with a desired and
constant traffic density. Constant density scenarios were used so that the number
of instantaneous conflicts logged during a simulation run could be attributed to
a particular traffic density. Since aircraft were deleted from the simulation as they

of instantaneous aircraft. Using this approach, ten traffic demand scenarios of

increasing density were defined, ranging between 5-100 aircraft per 10,000 NM(cid:4796)
in the simulation region. This corresponds to an instantaneous traffic demand of
between 80-1600 aircraft in the simulation region; see Table 3.7. Note that this
table displays the number of instantaneous aircraft in both the ‘simulation’ and
‘experiment’ regions.
In addition to constant densities, scenarios had a uniform distribution of trip dis-
tancesandaircraftheadings. Asexplainedpreviously,uniformdistancedistributions
were required to ensure a uniform vertical distribution of traffic. Uniform heading
distributions were used to maximize the number of instantaneous conflicts [69],
therebymakingiteasiertounderstandthesafetydifferencesbetweenunstructured
and layered airspaces.
The horizontal routes for aircraft were selected such that these two requirements
were met. This process began by randomly selecting the sector entry-point of an
aircraft as any latitude-longitude combination within the simulation region. Subse-
quently,twouniformrandomnumbergeneratorsareusedtooutputrandomvalues

It should be noted that all scenarios were generated off-line prior to the simula-
tions. Thisensuredthatallairspaceconceptscouldbesubjectedtothesametraffic

2 hrs, consisting of a 1 hour traffic volume buildup period, and a 1 hour logging
period during which the traffic density was kept constant.

3.5.3. Independent Variables
Three separate experiments were performed. The independent variables of each
experiment are discussed below.
3.5.3.1. Primary Experiment
The focus of the primary experiment was to validate the conflict count models for
under ideal conditions, and to investigate the effect of the allowed heading range 3
per altitude band on the safety of layered concepts. The independent variables of
this experiment were:
1. 5 airspace concepts, see Table 3.3
2. 10 traffic demand scenarios, see Table 3.7
For each traffic demand scenario, ten repetitions were performed using different
traffic realizations (i.e., different initial conditions). This resulted in a total of 500
simulation runs, involving over 950,000 flights.
3.5.3.2. Flight-Path Angle Experiment
The flight-path angle of climbing and descending traffic, 𝛾 , is an important pa-
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)
rameter that affects the proportion of aircraft in different flight phases, see sec-
tion 3.3.2. Hence, an experiment was performed to test conflict count model ac-
curacies for different values of 𝛾 . The independent variables of this experiment
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)
were:
1. 2 airspace concepts, namely UA and L45, see Table 3.3
2. 10 traffic demand scenarios, see Table 3.7
3. 3 𝛾 settings, see Table 3.5
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)
Ten repetitions were performed for each traffic demand condition. Therefore, a
total of 600 simulations runs were performed for this experiment, using over 1.15
million flights.

3.5.4. Dependent Variables
Todeterminetheaccuracyoftheconflictcountmodelsderivedinthischapter,model
3 predictionswerecomparedto actualconflict counts loggedduring the simulations.
Model accuracy was quantified by introducing a model accuracy parameter, 𝑘, as
illustrated below for the basic conflict count model:
No. of inst. conflicts=Gas Model × 𝑘
In essence, 𝑘 is a constant model term that accounts for any factor that was not
considered during model derivations. The value of 𝑘 is determined by fitting the
model (right side of above equation) to the conflict count data logged during the
simulations (left side of above equation) in a least-square sense. If 𝑘 = 1, then
themodels,asderived,areabletopredictconflictcountswith100%accuracy. On
the other hand, if 𝑘 < 1, then model output needs to be scaled down to fit the
simulation data, and thus the models are over-estimatingthe measured conflict
count. Conversely, if 𝑘 > 1, then model output needs to be scaled up to fit the
simulation data, and thus the models are under-estimatingthe measured conflict
count.
Since the conflict count model for layered airspaces consists of three terms, see
equation 3.20, three model accuracy parameters are used for layered airspaces,
namely, 𝑘 , 𝑘 and 𝑘 . These parameters represent model accuracy
(cid:4956)(cid:4971)(cid:4974)(cid:4962)(cid:4972)(cid:4958) (cid:4956)(cid:4971)(cid:4974)(cid:4962)(cid:4972)(cid:4958)(cid:4805)(cid:4956)(cid:4957) (cid:4956)(cid:4957)
for conflicts between cruising aircraft, for conflicts between cruising and climb-
ing/descendingaircraft,andforconflictsbetweenclimbing/descendingaircraft,re-
spectively. For UA, only one model accuracy parameter, 𝑘 , is used because no
(cid:4974)(cid:4954)
distinctionsaremadebetweenaircraftindifferentflightphasesbythecorrespond-
ing conflict count model, see equation 3.19.
Todeterminethevalueof𝑘usingleast-squares,duringthesimulations,thenumber
of instantaneous conflicts, and the number of instantaneous aircraft were logged
periodically every 15 seconds. Additionally only aircraft within the experiment re-
gion, and only conflicts with closest points of approach within the experiment re-
gion, were used to assess model accuracy. As mentioned earlier, this method for
counting aircraft and conflicts is used because the scenarios used for the simula-
tionshadatrafficdensityofzeroneartheedgesofthesimulationregion. Asimilar
approach to analyzing simulation data was used in [68].

3.6. Results
In this section, the results of the three simulation experiments are presented sep-
arately. The analysis considers the accuracy of the models, and the intrinsic safety
of unstructured and layered airspaces.
3.6.1. Primary Experiment
Asstatedpreviously,thegoaloftheprimaryexperimentistomeasuretheaccuracy 3
oftheconflictcountmodelsforbothunstructuredandlayeredairspacedesigns. Ad-
ditionally,thisexperimentalsoinvestigatedtheeffectofheadingrangeperaltitude
band on the intrinsic safety of layered concepts. These aspects are considered
below.
3.6.1.1. Validation of Model Structure
Before the absolute accuracy of the models can be evaluated, it is first necessary
to examine whether the basic structure of the conflict count models derived in
this work, described by equation 3.1, is sound. In essence, this aspect consid-
ers whether the models are able to correctly predict the shapeof the relationship
between the number of instantaneous aircraft and the number of instantaneous
conflicts. Based on the structure of equation 3.1, it can be seen that the ability
of the models to correctly describe the shape of the relationship between these
twovariablesisentirelydependentonthecombinatorialcomponentofthemodels,
which is, by definition, quadratic in nature; see for example equation 3.16. There-
fore,thevalidityofthestructureofthemodelscanbeanalyzedbyfittingsimulation

𝐶 = 𝑎𝑁(cid:4796), where 𝑁 is the number of instantaneous aircraft, and 𝑎 is the quadratic
coefficient that relates 𝑁 to 𝐶.

FromFigures3.10and3.11,itcanbeclearlyseenthatthenumberofconflictsdoes

the combinatorial component of the models. This conclusion is equally true of
the total conflict counts for UA and L45, as it is for the different conflict types
of L45. This later result is particularly relevant for layered airspaces, since the
correspondingmodelrequiresconflictsbetweenaircraftindifferentflightphasesto
be treated separately; see equation 3.20. Because similar trends were found for
theotherlayeredairspaceconcepts,aswellasfortheflight-pathangleandground
speed experiments (not shown), it can be concluded that the overall structure of
the models derived in this work is sound.

3.6.1.2. Model Accuracy
Sincethischapterproposesanalyticalconflictcountmodels,inadditiontochecking
the overall structure of the models, it is necessary to analyze the absolute accu-
racy of the models, i.e., the ability of the models to correctly estimate the number
of instantaneous conflicts for a given number of instantaneous aircraft and known
airspacedesignparameters(e.g. trafficseparationrequirements). Whilevalidation
ofthemodelstructurefocusedonthecombinatorialcomponentofthemodels,see
section3.6.1.1,theabsoluteaccuracyofthemodelsisinfluencedbyboththenum-
3
ber of combinations of two aircraft, and the average conflict probability between
any two aircraft. Absolute accuracy can be quantified using the model accuracy
parameter, 𝑘. As described in section 3.5.4, these ‘𝑘-constants’ can be thought
of as a scaling factor, and thus a value close to 1 indicates high model accuracy,
while 𝑘 < 1 and 𝑘 > 1 indicates over- and under-estimation of conflict counts,
respectively.
The values of 𝑘 for the primary experiment are given in Table 3.8 along with the
correspondingpercentageaccuracyresults. Hereitcanbeseenthattheoverallac-
curacy of the models is high. For example, for UA (𝑘 ), and for conflicts between
(cid:4974)(cid:4954)

Safety
Inadditiontotestingtheaccuracyofthemodels,datacollectedduringtheprimary
experiment was used to analyze the effect of the allowed heading range per flight
level, 𝛼, on intrinsic airspace safety; see Figure 3.12. In this figure, conflicts are
categorized according to the flight phases of interacting aircraft. Furthermore, for

tervalsofthenumberofinstantaneousconflictsforallrepetitionsperformedatthe
highest simulated traffic density. It should be noted that the same trends were
observed for all traffic densities (other densities not shown).
Figure 3.12 shows that a decrease of 𝛼 from L360 to L45 lowers the totalconflict
count(redline). Additionally,itcanbeseenthatthissafetyimprovementisentirely
due to the reduction of conflicts between cruising aircraft when 𝛼 is decreased
(green line). Because all layered concepts used the same number of flight levels,
basedontheconflictcountmodelforcruisingaircraftinlayeredairspaces,givenby
equation3.24,thisincreasedsafetycanbeexplainedbythereductionofhorizontal
relative velocities when 𝛼 is decreased.
Interestingly,Figure3.12alsoshowsthatthenumberofconflictsinvolvingclimbing
and descending traffic is invariant with 𝛼 (blue and violet lines). This is because
noneoftheairspaceconceptsconsideredhereapplyanyconstraintsonthepathsof
climbinganddescendingtraffic. Whiletheabsolutenumberofconflictswithclimb-
ing/descendingaircraftremainsconstant,theproportionofsuchconflictsincreases
as 𝛼 is decreased. This can be seen clearly for the L45 concept, for which 77.8%
of the total conflicts is caused by climbing/descending traffic. This suggests that

conflicts. Furthermore, this table also shows that the model predicted reductions

Although the analysis thus far has focused on layered airspaces, Figure 3.12 can
alsobeusedtocomparethesafetyofUAwiththatoflayeredconcepts. Inrelation
to this aspect, Figure 3.12 shows that UA results in significantly more (total) con-
flicts than for any of the layered concepts. This is also true when comparing UA to
the L360 concept. Since there are no heading-altitude constraints, and therefore
no reductions in relative velocities, for either of these two concepts, the increased
safetyofL360canbeattributedtotheonlyotherdifferencebetweenUAandlayered
concepts,i.e.,theuseofpredefinedflightlevelsforcruisingaircraftinlayeredcon-
cepts. As a result of these predefined flight levels, the model for layered airspaces
predicts a 30.9% reduction of the total conflicts for L360 when compared to UA at
thehighesttrafficdemand(thismatcheswelltothe35.5%reductionloggedduring
the simulations).
3.6.2. Flight-Path Angle Experiment
For a given set of origins, destinations and cruising altitudes, the flight path angle
of climbing and descending traffic, 𝛾 , affects the ratio between the number of
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)
instantaneousofcruisingvs. climbing/descendingaircraft. Thisisbecauseahigher
value of 𝛾 causes an aircraft to climb faster to its cruising altitude, leading to a
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)
higher proportion of cruising aircraft. Since the proportion of aircraft in different
flightphasesinfluencesboththeexpectedverticalrelativevelocityandtheaverage
conflict probability between aircraft, the effect of 𝛾 on the intrinsic safety of the

In contrast, Figure 3.13(b) shows that 𝛾 has a substantial effect on the total

conflict count for L45 (red line) , with safety increasing for higher 𝛾 . Although
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)
the number of conflicts involving cruising aircraft increases for L45 (green line),
it does so at a lower pace than for UA. In fact, the total conflict count for L45 is
mainly influenced by conflicts between cruising and climbing/descending aircraft
(blue line). This matches the trend found for the primary experiment, where the
majority of conflicts for layered airspaces with a narrow heading range per flight
level involve climbing/descending aircraft.

3.6.2.2. Effect of Flight-Path Angle on Model Accuracy
The effect of 𝛾 on model accuracy is displayed in Table 3.10. As exemplified by
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)
the total conflict count in Figure 3.13, Table 3.10 shows only a minor effect of 𝛾
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)
on model accuracy for UA, and for conflicts between cruising aircraft in layered
airspaces (see 𝑘 and 𝑘 rows). However, accuracy for conflicts involving
(cid:4974)(cid:4954) (cid:4956)(cid:4971)(cid:4974)(cid:4962)(cid:4972)(cid:4958)
climbing/descendingaircraftinlayeredairspacesappearstobesignificantlyaffected
by 𝛾 . As noted for the results of the primary experiment, the models show a
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)
tendency to over-estimate the number of such conflicts. Furthermore, the degree
3
of this overestimation worsens as 𝛾 increases.

An explanation for this trend can be found by considering the design of the simu-
lation experiments, and the relationship between 𝛾 and the volume of airspace
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)
searched for conflicts during conflict detection. Since 𝛾 affects the magnitude
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)
of the vertical relative velocity, it also affects the size of the verticalvolumeof
airspacesearchedforconflictsbyaircraft; seeFigure 3.6(b). Furthermore, notraf-
fic was simulated above and below the ‘simulation’ and ‘experiment’ regions; see
Figure 3.9. Therefore, climbing/descending aircraft, with vertical conflict search
volumes that extend outside the simulated sector, are less likely to detect conflicts
when compared to similar aircraft in the middle altitudes of the simulation. Be-
cause an increase in 𝛾 increases the size of the vertical conflict search volume,
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)
the number of climbing/descending aircraft that are negatively affected by this ef-
fect increases with 𝛾 , leading to a greater over-estimation by the conflict count
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)
models.
Itshouldbenotedthat,unliketheverticaldirection,themodelaccuracyresultsfor
cruising conflicts is notaffected by the fact that no traffic was simulated outside
the simulated sector. Although cruising conflict counts are affected by the hori-
zontalvolumeof airspace searched for conflicts in UA, and the horizontalareaof
airspace in layered concepts, only conflicts with closest points of approach within
the‘experiment’regionwereconsideredformodelaccuracyanalysis,asexplainedin
section3.5.4. Therefore,evenifthehorizontalconflictsearchvolume/areaextends
beyond the ‘experiment region’, the gap between the ‘experiment’ and ‘simulation’

--- Page 115 ---

96 3. Three-Dimensional Analytical Conflict Count Models
regions; see Figure 3.9, compensates for this unrealistic aspect of the simulation’s
design.
However, a similar distinction between ‘experiment’ and ‘simulation’ regions is not
feasible in the vertical direction since data from all cruising flight levels is needed
to evaluate model accuracies for layered airspaces. Moreover, a sudden drop in
densities is more realistic in the vertical direction; for example, commercial aircraft
do not usually fly above 45,000 ft. On the other hand, changes in traffic density
tend to be less abrupt in the horizontal direction for real operations (except near
3
andoveroceans),thusjustifyingthedistinctionbetweenexperimentandsimulation
regions used here in the horizontal plane.
3.6.3. Ground Speed Experiment
The analytical conflict count models derived in this chapter assume equal ground
speeds for all aircraft. This assumption was required to simplify a complex ex-
pression that is used to compute the expected horizontal relative velocity between
aircraft, see equation 3.4. However, this assumption is not representative of cur-
rent day en route operations because optimum cruising speeds vary with aircraft
type, and because wind direction and speed, which affects ground speed calcu-
lation, can vary significantly over large areas of airspace. Additionally, the equal
ground speed assumption does not allow for the possibility of overtaking conflicts
betweenaircraft. Consequently,toassessthesensitivityofthemodelstotheequal
groundspeedassumption,simulationswererepeatedforcaseswherethegrounds

3.6.3.1. EffectofGroundSpeedDistributiononIntrinsicAirspaceSafety
Figure 3.14 shows that speed distribution has a negligible effect on conflict counts
for UA. This is also largely true for L45, except for the slight increase in conflicts
between cruising aircraft when the speed distribution changes from ‘equal’ to ‘uni-
form’ (green line). This invariance of conflict counts with speed distribution can
be explained by the fact that the same average ground speed is used by all three
distributions (to enable a fair comparison). Therefore, while the speed distribution
ofaircraftmayhaveaneffectataperaircraftlevel,theoverallintrinsicsafetypro-
vided unstructured and layered airspaces is largely unaffected by the shape of the

speed of all aircraft in the airspace.

3.7. Discussion
In this chapter, analytical conflict count models were developed to analyze the in-
trinsic safety of unstructured and layered airspace designs. The models focused
on quantifying the effect of airspace design parameters and traffic demand on the 3
number of instantaneous system-wide conflicts. The models were validated using
extensive fast-time simulation experiments that involved over three million flights.
This section reflects on the intrinsic safety offered by unstructured and layered
airspaces, and discusses the accuracy of the models. Additionally, important as-
pects related to model usage are also considered.
3.7.1. IntrinsicSafetyofUnstructuredandLayeredAirspace
Designs
The results of all simulation experiments performed in this study showed that air-
craft in unstructured airspace are subject to more conflicts than aircraft in layered
airspaces. The higher intrinsic safety of layered airspaces can be attributed to two
factors that reduce the number of conflicts between cruising aircraft.
The first factor is related to the allowed heading range per flight level. For layered
concepts that reduce the allowed heading range per flight level, relative veloci-
tiesbetweencruisingaircraftarereducedcomparedtounstructuredairspace. This
reduction in relative velocities, which stems from a greater alignment of cruising
traffic in each flight level, reduces conflict probabilities between neighboring air-
craft. Whilethiseffectwasalreadyhypothesizedinourpriorwork[74],thecurrent
study quantifies this effect, and shows that the corresponding safety benefits are
nonlinearwiththeallowedheadingrange. Forexample,loweringtheheadingrange
per flight level from 360(cid:4968) to 90(cid:4968) reduces the number of conflicts between cruising
aircraft by approximately 60%. However, further halving the heading range per
flight level to 45(cid:4968) only provides an additional 20% reduction in conflicts.
Thesecondfactorthatimprovesthesafetyperformanceoflayeredairspacesisthe
useofpredefinedflightlevelsforcruisingaircraft. Usingpredefinedflightlevelsnot
onlyreducesthenumberofcombinationsofaircraftthatcanconflictwitheachother,
it also reduces the conflict probability between aircraft. This is because in layered
airspaces, conflicts can only occur between cruising aircraft if both aircraft are at
the same flight level. Consequently, in layered concepts, conflict probability for
cruisingaircraftisafunctionoftheareasearchedforconflicts. Ontheotherhand,
conflict probability is directly proportional to the volumesearched for conflicts in
unstructuredairspace,sincetherearenoverticalconstraintsonaircraftmotion. The
larger region of airspace searched for conflicts in unstructured airspace, therefore,

--- Page 119 ---

100 3. Three-Dimensional Analytical Conflict Count Models
increases conflict probability and the number of conflicts encountered by cruising
aircraft.
Althoughlayereddesignsimprovetheoverallsafetyofenrouteairspacesbyreduc-
ing conflicts between cruising aircraft, it is worth noting that no differences were
observed between unstructured and layered concepts in relation to the number
of conflicts involving climbing/descending aircraft. In fact, the simulation results
clearly showed that as the heading range per flight level is decreased, thepropor-
tionofconflictsinvolvingclimbing/descendingaircraftisincreased. Therefore,such
3
conflicts can become more influential than conflicts between cruising aircraft, par-
ticularly for layered airspaces with a narrow heading range per flight level. While
the magnitude of this trend is affected by the ratio of cruising vs. climbing/de-
scending aircraft, which is in turn influenced by the flight path angles of climbing
and descending traffic, this result does emphasize the need to take into account
conflicts between aircraft in different phases when assessing the overall intrinsic
safety of an airspace design.
3.7.2. Conflict Count Model Validation
By comparing simulation results to model predictions, model accuracy was deter-
mined to be high for both airspace designs. For example, in addition to correctly
predicting the shape of the relationship between the numbers of instantaneous
aircrafts and conflicts, the models could also estimate the effect of the allowed
headingrangeperflightlevelonconflictcountswithanaccuracygreaterthan90%
the models could also calculate the effect of using predefined cruising altitudes on
safety with a similar level of accuracy.
The accuracy of all models is, to some degree, affected by the assumptions upon
whichtheyarederived. Themodelsderivedherearenoexceptiontothisrule,and
two assumptions negatively affected conflict count estimation. The first assump-
tion was that all aircraft have equal ground speeds, and it was required to derive
purelyanalyticalconflictcountmodels. Becausethisassumptiondoesnotconsider
the occurrence of over-taking conflicts, and because such conflicts are more likely
to occur as the heading range per altitude band is decreased, model accuracy for
layered airspaces was negatively affected by this assumption. Nevertheless, accu-
racy was shown to be increased to the level found for the equal speed assumption
when the analytical models were augmented with numerically computed values of
the expected horizontal relative velocity. It is hypothesized that the effect of other
trafficscenariorelatedassumptions,suchastheuniformlydistributedheadingdis-
tributionsusedinthiswork,canalsobecompensatedforinasimilarmanner. Such
changes could be used to expand the models to account for the traffic flow and
demand distributions of current-day operations.
Model accuracy was also affected by the fact that the models assume airspace
to be infinite in extent, both horizontally and vertically. While this assumption is
convenientformodelingpurposes,itisanobviousdeviationfromreality. Therefore,
the simulations performed to validate the models used a finite volume of airspace.

--- Page 120 ---

3.7. Discussion 101
Although this approach made the simulations more realistic, it also caused traffic
density to drop to zero at the boundaries to the simulated sector. Since traffic
densityrarelydropssodrasticallyinthehorizontaldirectionforrealoperations,the
modelswereonlyvalidatedfordataloggedwithinahorizontallydefinedexperiment
region at the center of the simulated sector. However, a similar approach in the
vertical direction was deemed to be unrealistic, given the altitude related flight
envelope limitations of aircraft. Therefore, the accuracy results presented in this
chapter are representative of the range of values that could be obtained using the
models for real operations, if such data were to become available in the future for 3
unstructured and layered en route airspaces.
Despitetheselimitations,asnotedabove,modelaccuracywasgenerallyquitehigh.
This high accuracy allows the models to be used as tools to compare unstructured
and layered airspaces, as well as to evaluate the effects of a number of safety
relevant parameters, such as conflict detection look-ahead time and traffic separa-
tion requirements. Additionally, since the models derived here take into account
theproportionofaircraftindifferentflightphaseswhencomputingconflictcounts,
they provide a more comprehensive understanding on the overall intrinsic safety
provided by a particular airspace design when compared to previous studies that
have only considered cruising aircraft. This aspect is particularly important during
thedesignoflayeredairspaceswhere,asnotedabove,climbing/descendingtraffic
can cause the majority of conflicts under certain design choices.
3.7.3. Additional Considerations
Although the models were tested within the context of high-altitude commercial
operations,theycanalsobeappliedtothedesignandanalysisofunstructuredand
layered airspace concepts for low-altitude unmanned aircraft ops. This is possible
because the generic, analytical nature of the models allows a generalization of the
results beyond the specific conditions that have been simulated in this study, for
instance for the lower speeds anticipated for unmanned traffic. On a similar note,
theunderlyingapproachusedheretomodelsystem-wideconflictcountscould,with
someadditions,alsobeexpandedtootherairspacedesigns,includingforconcepts
closer to today’s mode of operations. Any adaptations along these lines would
require an analysis of how the constraints imposed by a particular airspace design
affectthenumberofcombinationsoftwoaircraft,andtheaverage(horizontaland
vertical) relative velocities between aircraft.
It is important to realize that the conflict count models considered here measure
safety as a function of airspace design only. Other factors that affect safety, in-
cludinguncertaintiesrelatedtoaircraftstatemeasurement/communication,arenot
consideredbythemodelssincetheseaspectsarenotdirectlyaffectedbythedesign

aircraft state measurement/communication are not expected to significantly affect
the results presented here, particularly for future operations with ADS-B.
Another factor that is not considered by the notion of intrinsicsafety, and by the
models presented here, is the effect of tactical conflict resolutions on airspace
safety. In fact, the overallsafetyof operations is affected by both the selected
airspace design and the selected conflict resolution approach. This is particularly

Many ATM studies interrelate airspace safety and capacity. Although these two
metricsarecloselyconnected,airspaceconceptsthatmaximizesafetyneednotbe

sideration when arguing for or against a particular airspace design, or when fine-
tuningtheparametersoftheselectedairspacedesign. Thisnotioncanbeillustrated
for the layers concept; although decreasing the heading range per flight level im-
proves safety, it also increases the number of flight levels needed to specify all
possible travel directions. Therefore, for a given volume of airspace, it may be

when evaluating thecapacityof an airspace design, it is necessary to consider the
effect of a design on multiple airspace performance metrics in unison, including
safety and efficiency. The approach used to model intrinsic airspace safety in this
chapter is a good starting point to develop a capacity assessment method along
these lines.
3.8. Conclusions
This chapter presented analytical conflict count models to measure the intrinsic
safety of unstructured and layered en-route airspace designs. The models take
into account the three-dimensional motion of aircraft, and therefore improve upon
previousstudiesbyconsideringconflictsbetweenaircraftindifferentflightphases.

The following conclusions can be drawn:
1. Layeredairspaceconceptswerefoundtobesaferthanunstructuredairspace.
Thisisbecauselayeredairspacesrestricttheheadingrangeallowedperflight

possible conflict pairs.

2. Thesafetyperformanceoflayeredairspacesincreasesastheheadingrange

velocities between cruising aircraft as the heading range per flight level is
decreased. The relationship between the number of instantaneous conflicts
and the heading range per flight level is nonlinear.

4.1. Introduction
ThecurrentsystemofAirTrafficManagement(ATM)reliesonacentralizedcontrol
architecture. Atitscore,thissystemisheavilydependentonhumanAirTrafficCon-
trollers (ATCos) to ensure safe separation between aircraft. While this system has
served the needs of the air transportation industry thus far, the increasing delays
and congestion reported in many parts of the world indicate that the current cen-
tralized operational model is rapidly approaching saturation levels [12, 17].
To cater for the expected future increases in traffic demand, several studies have
proposed a transition to a decentralizedtraffic separation paradigm in en route
airspace [30, 33, 91–93]. In decentralized airspace, each individual aircraft is re-
sponsible for its own separation with all surrounding traffic. To facilitate decentral-
ization,manystudieshavefocusedonthedevelopmentofautomatedairborneCon-

flictDetectionandResolution(CD&R)algorithms[49,111–113]. Someresearchers
have also considered if such algorithms can be combined with alternate options
for structuring traffic to further increase safety and capacity over current opera-
tions [57, 74, 114].
To evaluate the algorithms and the airspace designs that have been developed to
implement decentralized control, most studies in this domain have used fast-time
simulation experiments. Although fast-time simulations provide intuitive insights
on the advantages and disadvantages of decentralized systems, they can be time
consuming to develop, depending on the required level of realism. Furthermore,
the results of such simulation studies can be very specific to the way they are
performed, and this can make it difficult to extrapolate their results beyond the
specific conditions that have been tested.
4
To overcome the aforementioned limitations of fast-time simulations, some re-
searchershavederivedmathematicalmodelstogainamorequantitativeandgener-
alizableunderstandingoftheinteractionsbetweenaircraftindecentralizedsystems.
Whensuchmethodsareusedtoanalyzethesafetyofanairspacedesign,theyoften
make use of the so called ‘gas modeling’ approach [29, 66, 68–70]. This approach
is inspired by the collisions that occur between ideal gas particles, and it deter-
minesinstantaneous system-wideconflictcounts between aircraftasa measureof
airspacesafety. Becausethisapproachusesmeasurableairspaceparameters,such
astrafficdemandandseparationrequirements,asinputs,gasmodelscanbeused
to understand the factors that affect the safety of an airspace design.
However, to develop closed-form analytical expressions, most ‘gas models’ de-
scribedinliteraturemakeuseofidealizedassumptionsregardingthespeed,head-
ing, altitude and spatial/density distributions of traffic. Collectively, these four dis-
tributions describe what is often referred to as a trafficscenario. Typically, the
following four traffic scenario assumptions are used in the derivation of analytical
gas-models:
• Equal ground speed for all aircraft
• Uniform heading distribution
• Uniform altitude distribution
• Uniform spatial/density distribution
Inpractice,however,atrafficscenariowiththeseexactcombinationofpropertiesis
unlikely to occur. This raises the question of the accuracy of such models for more
realistic traffic scenarios.
In this research, the accuracy of analytical gas models is tested for cases that do
not respect the above ‘ideal’ traffic scenario assumptions. For this purpose, three-
dimensional analytical gas-models for unstructured and layered en route airspace
designs,derivedinourpriorwork[88],areusedascase-studies. Forbothairspace
designs, model accuracy was measured by comparing the predictions of the corre-
spondingmodelstotheresultsoffourfast-timesimulationexperimentswithvarying

speed, heading, altitude and spatial distributions. In each experiment, one of the
four traffic scenario assumptions is violated while respecting the other three as-
sumptions in orderto determine the effect of each assumption on model accuracy.
The data collected from these simulations is also used to test so called ‘model ad-
justments’ that aim to relax the dependency of the conflict count models on the
idealized traffic scenario assumptions. The adjusted models use numerical meth-
ods to evaluate complex integrals that can not be solved analytically for non-ideal
traffic scenarios.
This chapter begins with a summary of the necessary background material in sec-
tion 4.2. This is followed by an overview of the baseline analytical conflict count

approach is developed to generalize the models for more realistic traffic scenarios.
The design of the simulation experiments used to assess model accuracy is de-
scribed in section 4.5. The results of the simulations are presented and discussed
in sections 4.6and 4.7, respectively. Finally, the main conclusions of this study are
summarized in section 4.8.
4.2. Background
Thissectionpresentsthedefinitionsandbackgroundmaterialrelevanttothischap-
ter. It begins with descriptions of the two airspace concepts of interest to this
study, namely unstructured and layered airspace designs. Additionally, this section

4.2.1. The Unstructured Airspace Design Concept
As the name suggests, no constraints are imposed on aircraft motion in Unstruc-
turedAirspace(UA).Instead,thissimplestformofairspacedesignfocusesonmaxi-
mizingoverallsystemefficiency. Therefore,aircraftarefreetousedirecthorizontal

domtoaircraftoperators,UAhasbeenfoundtoresultinamoreuniformdistribution
of traffic, both horizontally and vertically, relative to current day operations. This
can in turn reduce traffic concentrations and ensuing delays [29, 30].
4.2.2. The ‘Layers’ Airspace Design Concept
Several different layered airspace concepts have been discussed in literature [95–
97]. The specific variation under consideration in this work was developed in our
prior work [74], and is known as the ‘Layers’ concept.

--- Page 128 ---

4.2. Background 109
The Layers concept can be seen as an extension to the hemispheric/semicircular
rule [79]. In this concept, the airspace is segmented into vertically stacked bands,
and heading-altitude rules are used to limit the range of travel directions allowed
in each altitude layer. Although the Layers concept dictates the vertical profile of a
flight,operatorsarefreetoselectdirecthorizontalrouteswhenpossible. Moreover,
climbing and descending aircraft are exempted from the heading-altitude rules,
and can violate them to reach their cruising altitude or destination. This exception
avoids inefficient ‘spirals’ when climbing/descending.

An example Layers concept is shown in Figure 4.1. Two parameters define the
topologyoftheLayersconcept. Thefirstparameteristhespacingbetweenaltitude
bands,𝜁. Animportantdesignrequirementisthat𝜁 isatleastequaltothevertical
separation requirement to prevent conflicts between aircraft cruising in adjacent
flight levels. In this work, a vertical separation requirement of 1000 ft is used.
Therefore,thealtitudebandsoftheLayersconceptsconsideredhereareseparated
by𝜁 =1100ft;theextra100ftisusedtopreventsocalled‘false’conflictsthatcan
sometimes occur due to any slight overshooting of altitude when aircraft level-off
at their desired flight level. Such an offset is also necessary to account for any
height-keeping errors, and because of turbulence.
The second design parameter of the Layers concept is the heading range allowed
per altitude band, 𝛼. For the layered airspace shown in Figure 4.1, 𝛼 = 90(cid:4968),
and consequently, this particular concept is referred to as Layers-90, or ‘L90’ for
short. For L90, four flight levels are needed to specify all possible flight directions,
and define one complete ‘set’ of layers. On the other hand, for a L180 concept
(not shown), only two flight levels are needed to define a complete set of layers.
Therefore, for L180, two complete sets of layers would fit within the volume of
airspace needed for L90. When multiple sets of layers are available, the total trip
distance of an aircraft is used in addition to its heading to determine its cruising
altitude. In this way, short flights can use lower layer sets, and longer flights can

use higher layer sets, to reduce the negative effect of predetermined altitudes on
flight efficiencies.

4.2.3. Conflicts vs. Intrusions
InATM,safetyisoftenmeasuredintermsofthenumberofconflictsandintrusions.
4 A conflict is defined to occur if the horizontal and vertical distances between two
or more aircraft are expected to be less than the prescribed separation standards
within a predetermined ‘look-ahead’ time. Conflicts are, therefore, predictions of
futureseparation violations. Conflicts should not be confused with intrusions. In-
stead, intrusions, also referred to as losses of separation, occur when separation
requirements are violated at the presenttime. This distinction between conflicts
and intrusions is shown in Figure 4.2.

4.2.4. Gas Models for Estimating Conflict Counts
As mentioned earlier, previous studies have presented so called ‘gas-models’ to
compute the number of instantaneous conflicts that occur in a given volume of
airspace. Gas models compute the number of instantaneous conflicts as a product
of two factors; the number of combinations of two aircraft, and the average con-
flict probability between any two aircraft. In essence, the number of combinations
of two aircraft is the maximum number of instantaneous conflicts that can occur,

all gas models can be written out in words as:
No. of Combinations of Two Aircraft
No. Inst. Conflicts = ×
Average Conflict Probability Between Any Two Aircraft
(4.1)
Here, different airspace designs can influence both the number of possible com-
binations of aircraft, as well as the average conflict probability between any two
aircraft.
Gas models are named as such because the combinatorial characteristic that is
central to this approach was initially used in the field of statistical mechanics to
determine the number of collisions that can occur between the molecules of an
idealgas[98]. InATM,gasmodelswerefirstproposedinthe1960stoanalyzethe
collision risk between adjacent routes of the North Atlantic track system [67, 99,
100]. Subsequently, they have also been used to investigate the safety of a wide
variety of airspace types, including high altitude en route airways [101–103], low
altitude terminal airspaces [69, 104–106], and for concepts that closely resemble
unstructured and layered airspace concepts [20, 30, 66, 68, 70, 88].
It is important to note that gas models measure the so called ‘intrinsic safety’ pro-
videdbyanairspacedesign. Thenotionofintrinsicsafetyfocusesexclusivelyonthe
safetythatisprovidedbytheconstraintsimposedonaircraftmotionbyaparticular
airspace design. As such, intrinsic safety considers the situation withouttactical
conflict resolution. Nonetheless, because any conflict that could not be prevented
byanairspacedesignrequiressomeintervention,thenotionofintrinsicsafetycan
be used as an indication of the workload experienced by pilots and/or ATCos in

solvingconflictsundertheconsideredairspaceconcept. Itisalsoimportanttonote
that although measurement and communication uncertainties can affect the num-
ber of observed, or perceived, conflicts for a particular aircraft, such uncertainties
are unrelated to the design of an airspace. Consequently, the intrinsic safety pro-
vided by an airspace design is only concerned with the ‘truly occurring’ conflicts in
an airspace.
Asimpliedabove,gasmodelsarewellestablishedinthedomainofairspacesafety
analysis. However, most previous studies have derived such models using ideal-
ized assumptions regarding the speed, heading, altitude and spatial distributions
of traffic in order to obtain closed-form analytical expressions that are easy to use
and understand. However, as a result of these assumptions, it is as yet unknown
whether such models are applicable for more realistic traffic scenarios. To provide
4
moreclarityonthisaspect,inthiswork,fast-timesimulationexperimentsareused
to examine the effect of each traffic scenario assumption on the accuracy of an-
alytical gas models. Additionally, this chapter also presents the derivation of so
called ‘model adjustments’ that can generalize gas models for a wider range traf-
fic scenarios using a numerical approach. To these ends, analytical conflict count
models for unstructured and layered en route airspace designs are used as case
studies.
4.3. Baseline Analytical Conflict Count Models
This section summarizes the baseline analytical conflict count models for unstruc-
turedandlayeredenrouteairspacedesigns;thefullderivationcanbefoundin[88].
These analytical models assume equal ground speeds for all aircraft, as well as a
uniform distribution of aircraft headings, altitudes and spatial locations.

can be computed directly using the binomial coefficient, since this airspace design
imposes no constraints on the motion of aircraft; see section 4.2.1. Therefore for
UA, 𝐶 can be expressed as [70, 88]:

4 neous cruising aircraft. Note that the derivation of the above equations for the
expected relative velocities decomposes aircraft trajectories into cruising, climbing
anddescendingflightphases[88]. Whileadditionalflightphasescanbetakeninto
account by the underlying derivation procedure, a segmentation into these three
flight phases is considered to be adequate for en route airspaces [88].
4.3.2. Layered Airspace
The altitude constraints imposed by the Layers concept reduces the number of
conflicts between cruising aircraft relative to UA. However, no procedural mecha-
nismsareusedtoseparatecruisingaircraftfromclimbinganddescendingtrafficin
layered airspaces; see section 4.2.2. Therefore, the conflict count model for lay-
ered airspaces needs to be split into three distinct parts based on the flight phase
combinations of interacting aircraft:
𝐶 =𝐶 +𝐶 +𝐶 (4.5)
(cid:4965)(cid:4954)(cid:4978) (cid:4956)(cid:4971)(cid:4974)(cid:4962)(cid:4972)(cid:4958) (cid:4956)(cid:4971)(cid:4974)(cid:4962)(cid:4972)(cid:4958)(cid:4805)(cid:4956)(cid:4957) (cid:4956)(cid:4957)
Here, 𝐶 is the number of conflicts between cruising aircraft, 𝐶 is the
(cid:4956)(cid:4971)(cid:4974)(cid:4962)(cid:4972)(cid:4958) (cid:4956)(cid:4971)(cid:4974)(cid:4962)(cid:4972)(cid:4958)(cid:4805)(cid:4956)(cid:4957)
number of conflicts between cruising and climbing/descending aircraft, and 𝐶 is
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)
the number of conflicts between climbing/descending traffic. Each of these three
conflict types are discussed in the paragraphs that follow.
4.3.2.1. Conflicts Between Cruising Aircraft
Since the vertical spacing between the predefined flight levels of the Layers con-
ceptis,bydefinition, atleastequaltotheverticalseparationrequirement,cruising
aircraft in different flight levels cannotconflict with each other; see section 4.2.2.
This in turn reduces the number of possible conflict pairs for cruising aircraft. If
aircraft are uniformly distributed over all available flight levels, 𝐿, then the number
of instantaneous cruising conflicts can be computed as [70, 88]:

Here, 𝑝 is the average conflict probability between two arbitrary cruising air-

craft. Because cruising aircraft in layered airspaces are required to maintain con-
stant altitudes, the velocities of cruising aircraft are purely horizontal. If traffic
density is assumed to be uniform in each flight level, then it is possible to show
that 𝑝 is equal to the ratio between the average area of airspace searched

In the above equation, E(𝑉 ) is the expected horizontal relative velocity

4.3.2.2. ConflictsBetweenCruisingandClimbing/DescendingAircraft
Because the Layers concept imposes no constraints to prevent conflicts between
cruising and climbing/descending traffic, the model for 𝐶 is very similar to

the model developed for UA, except for two minor differences:

The model describing the number of instantaneous conflicts between climbing/de-

only difference is in the computation of the expected vertical relative velocity be-

4.4. Traffic Scenario Adjusted Conflict
Count Models
As indicated previously, the baseline analyticalconflict count models rely on ide-
alized assumptions regarding the speed, heading, altitude and spatial distributions
of aircraft. If these assumptions are not respected, usage of the analytical mod-
els is expected to lead to inaccurate conflict count predictions. By analyzing the
assumptions, as well as where they affect the equations, this section proposesnu-
mericaladjustmentstoincreasetheaccuracyofthemodelsformorerealistictraffic
scenarios, for both unstructured and layered airspace designs.
The accuracies of the baseline and adjusted models are determined in this study
by comparing model predictions to empirical conflict count data obtained using 4
fast-time simulation experiments. Because the adjustments use numerical meth-
odstogeneralizemodelcomponents,theyarederivedforthesametrafficscenario
distributions as used in the experiments. Note that all numerical integrations are
performed here using the simple ‘trapezoidal rule’ [115]. Moreover, model ad-
justments are derived separately for each of the four traffic scenario assumptions.
Consequently,eachadjustmentappliestothecasewhereonlyoneofthefourideal
traffic scenario assumptions is violated, while respecting the other three assump-
tions.
4.4.1. Ground Speed Distribution Adjustment
An important step in the deviation of conflict count models is the computation of
the expected relative velocity between aircraft, E(𝑉), as it is needed to compute
(cid:4971)
the average conflict probability between aircraft, 𝑝; see equation 4.3 for UA, and
equations 4.7, 4.9b and 4.10b for layered airspaces. To derive expressions for
E(𝑉), the analytical conflict count models for both airspace designs of interest
(cid:4971)
assumeequalgroundspeedsforallaircraft. Becauseflightpathanglesarerelatively
small in en route airspaces, this assumption mainly affects the calculation of the
expectedhorizontalrelative velocity between aircraft, E(𝑉 ).
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
To understand how the equal ground speed assumption affects the calculation of
E(𝑉 ),itisusefultofirstconsiderthemagnitudeofthehorizontalrelativevelocity
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
between two arbitrary aircraft, 𝑉 ; see Figure 4.6. If both aircraft are assumed to
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
have equal speeds, i.e., if 𝑉 = 𝑉 = 𝑉, then the geometry between 𝑉, 𝑉 and 𝑉
(cid:4795) (cid:4796) (cid:4795) (cid:4796) (cid:4971),(cid:4961)
becomes an isosceles triangle. Therefore, 𝑉 can be computed simply as:

𝑉 =2 𝑉 sin( ) (4.11)

(cid:4794)
Here, 𝛼 is the maximum heading difference between two arbitrary aircraft in the
airspace. ForUA,𝛼 =360(cid:4968) sincetherearenoconstraintsonaircraftmotioninthis

By using equation 4.12 to compute E(𝑉 ), the baseline analytical conflict count
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
models for both unstructured and layered airspaces assumes that E(𝑉 ) is only
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
dependent on one probability density function, i.e., that of the absolute heading
difference between two arbitrary aircraft, 𝑃(|Δ𝜓|). Evaluation of equation 4.12
using the appropriate values of 𝛼 results in relatively simple analytical expressions
forE(𝑉 );seeequation4.4aforUA,andequation4.8forlayeredairspaces.
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
However, for real-life operations, all aircraft in a given volume of airspace are un-
likelytoflywithequalgroundspeeds. Thiscanbeduetoseveralreasonsincluding
the fact that different aircraft types have different optimum cruising speeds, and
because standard operating procedures vary between different airlines. If aircraft
arenotassumedtoflywithequalgroundspeeds,thenthemodelforE(𝑉 )must
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
be adjusted to take into account the actual speed distributions of all aircraft in the
airspace.
To begin the derivation of the ground speed adjusted model for E(𝑉 ), it is once
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
again useful to reconsider the computation of 𝑉 for an arbitrary pair of aircraft,
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
see Fig. 4.6. If 𝑉 ≠ 𝑉, the cosine rule needs to be used to rewrite equation 4.11

Since the values of 𝑉, 𝑉 and |Δ𝜓| can be different for every aircraft pair in the
(cid:4795) (cid:4796)
airspace, to compute the ground speed adjusted version of equation 4.12, it is
necessary to integrate equation 4.13 over all possible values of velocity and ab-
solute heading difference, while taking into account the probability density func-
tions of velocity magnitudes and absolute heading differences, 𝑃(𝑉), 𝑃(𝑉) and

(4.14)
Due to the complexity of equation 4.14, the ground speed model adjustment can
only be evaluated numerically. This has been performed for the four speed dis-
tributions displayed in Figure 4.7, while assuming a uniform distribution of aircraft
headings (as stated previously, the model adjustments consider the effect of one
scenario assumption at a time). Here the equal speed case corresponds to the as-
sumptionusedbythebaselineanalyticalmodel. Thephysicalinterpretationforthe
other three distributions corresponds to the hypothetical distributions of different
aircraft types in a particular volume of airspace. For example, a bimodal speed
distribution can occur if there are two dominant aircraft types in an airspace, e.g.
737s and A320s.

More interestingly, the table indicates that ground speed distribution has a very
minor effect on E(𝑉 ); varying the speed distribution from its ‘ideal’ setting only
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
causes slightly higher values of E(𝑉 ) for all the airspace concepts considered
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
here. Consequently,groundspeeddistributionisnotexpectedtohaveasignificant
impact on the accuracy of the baseline analytical conflict count models for UA, or
forthelayeredairspaceconceptsconsideredinthiswork. Thishypothesisistested
using simulation experiments; see section 4.6.2.
4.4.2. Heading Distribution Adjustment
As implied by equation 4.14, in addition to the speed distribution of aircraft, the
expected horizontal relative velocity between aircraft, E(𝑉 ), is also affected by
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
theprobabilitydensityfunctionoftheabsoluteheadingdifferencebetweenaircraft,
𝑃(|Δ𝜓|). The baseline analytical models assume a uniform distribution of aircraft
headings between 0 and 𝛼, where 𝛼 = 360(cid:4968) for UA, and depends on the spe-
cific heading-altitude rule selected for layered airspaces. For this ‘ideal’ heading
distribution, it can be shown that 𝑃(|Δ𝜓|) has a triangular shape between 0 and
𝛼 [70]:
2 |Δ𝜓|
𝑃(|Δ𝜓|) = (1− ) (4.15)
(cid:4974)(cid:4967)(cid:4962)(cid:4959)(cid:4968)(cid:4971)(cid:4966) 𝛼 𝛼
Logically, the above expression for 𝑃(|Δ𝜓|) should only be used to evaluate equa-
tion 4.14 when aircraft headings are uniformly distributed between 0 and 𝛼. How-
ever, thebaselineanalyticalconflictcountmodelsassumeauniformdistributionof
headings regardless of the actual heading distribution observed for a given traffic
scenario. Therefore, the accuracies of the analytical models are expected to be
reduced if aircraft headings are not uniformly distributed.
To ensure high model accuracy for other ‘non-ideal’ heading distributions, the ap-
propriate function for 𝑃(|Δ𝜓|) should be used when numerically evaluating equa-
tion 4.14. In this work, the four heading distributions pictured in Figure 4.8 are

by the baseline analytical model. The normal and ranged-uniform heading distri-
butions represent traffic scenarios with one, or a range of, predominant aircraft
headings; these two cases are representative of traffic moving towards oceanic
airspace. The bimodal distribution, on the other hand, is used to consider scenar-
ios with head-on traffic. This could be indicative of the traffic pattern between the
east and west coasts of the United States. For these cases, the following expres-

usingtheappropriateexpressionslistedabovefor𝑃(|Δ𝜓|). Asbefore,theeffectof
each traffic scenario assumption is considered on a case-by-case basis, and there-
fore,inthiscontext,equation4.14isevaluatedwhileassumingequalspeedsforall
aircraft,i.e.,usingthespeedsettingcorrespondingtotheidealtrafficscenario. For
a similar reason, only the UA and L360 concepts are used to assess the impact of
heading distribution on model accuracy. This is because aircraft altitude is closely
tied to aircraft heading for layered designs with 𝛼 < 360(cid:4968), see equation 4.25.
Consequently, it is not possible to alter aircraft heading distribution without ad-
versely affecting the altitude distribution from its ideal setting for such airspace
designs.
Table 4.2 shows that E(𝑉 ) is the highest for the uniform heading distribution,
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
althoughthereisnosubstantialdifferencebetweentheuniformandbimodalcases.

However, E(𝑉 ) is significantly lower for the normal and ranged-uniform heading
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
distributions when compared to the uniform/ideal case. Therefore, the baseline
analyticalmodelsforbothunstructuredandlayeredairspacesareexpectedtoover-
estimateconflict counts when aircraft headings are normally or ranged-uniformly
distributed.
4.4.3. Altitude Distribution Adjustment
In en route airspace, most aircraft are in the cruise phase of flight. Therefore, the
uniform altitude distribution assumption made by the baseline analytical models
appliesmainlyto cruising aircraft. Although this is true for both unstructured and
layered airspaces, unlike the other traffic scenario assumptions, the model adjust-
mentsrequiredtotakeintoaccountthealtitudedistributionofcruisingtrafficdiffers
between these two airspace designs. The following paragraphs present the model
adjustments needed for each airspace design separately.
4.4.3.1. Unstructured Airspace
ForUA,equation4.3showsthatconflictprobabilityiscomputedasthesummation
oftworatios;1)theratiobetweenthevolumesearchedforconflictsinthehorizontal
direction, 𝐵 , and the total airspace volume, 𝐵 , and 2) the ratio between the

volume searched for conflicts in the vertical direction, 𝐵 , and 𝐵 . The first
(cid:4956),(cid:4975) (cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965)
of these two ratios assumes a uniform distribution of aircraft cruising altitudes.
However, if traffic is not spread-out uniformly in the vertical direction, then aircraft
inbusieraltitudesaremorelikelytoexperienceconflictsthanaircraftinlessdense
altitudes.
To take into account the vertical distribution of aircraft for a given traffic scenario,
the altitude-related model adjustment for UA introduces a new variable 𝑝 . This
(cid:4975)
variableconsiderstheeffectofcruisingaltitudedistributionontheaverageconflict
probability between aircraft, 𝑝 , and it can be calculated as [69]:

Here, 𝑍 and 𝑍 are the minimum and maximum altitudes of the airspace

volume of interest, and 𝑃 represents the probability density function of aircraft
(cid:4979)
cruising altitudes. Additionally, ℎ is the altitude variable for an aircraft 𝑖, and 𝑢 is
thealtitudevariableforanaircraft𝑗,whereaircraftsiandjaretwoarbitraryaircraft 4
in the airspace. In essence the inner integral in the above equation considers the
probability that aircraft 𝑗 is located within the vertical separation requirement of
aircraft 𝑖, and the outer integral evaluates the probability that aircraft 𝑖 is located
within the upper and lower altitudes of the airspace volume of interest. If aircrafts
𝑖 and 𝑗 are both assumed to be located within the same airspace, then 𝑃 is the
(cid:4979)
same for both aircraft.
Using equation 4.17, it is possible to derive a generalized model for 𝑝 that takes
(cid:4974)(cid:4954)
into account the vertical distribution of traffic. To illustrate this process, it is useful
reverse engineer the expression used by the baseline analytical model for 𝑝 .
(cid:4974)(cid:4954)
To this end, equation 4.17 is evaluated for the case where aircraft altitudes are
uniformly distributed:

representative of current en route operations over continental airspace. A similar

that a uniform distribution of altitudes leads to the lowest conflict probability be-

4.4.3.2. Layered Airspace
Cruising aircraft in layered airspaces are required to fly at predefined altitudes;
see section 4.2.2. Consequently, conflict probability for cruising aircraft in layered
airspaces is a function of the areasearched for conflicts by an aircraft. Since the

4.4.4. Spatial Distribution Adjustment
Conflictprobabilitycomputationbythebaselineanalyticalmodelsforbothunstruc-
tured and layered airspace designs assume an equal likelihood of conflicts in all
parts of the airspace. However, if the spatial/density distribution of traffic is not
uniform, then moreconflicts arelikelyto occurin airspace areas with higher traffic
densities.
To deal with the effect of so called traffic density ‘hot-spots’ on conflict counts, the
modeladjustmentforthespatialdistributionoftrafficdiscretizestheairspaceintoa
numberofsmallerareas,eachwithamoreuniformdistributionofaircraftlocations.
Subsequently, the total conflict count for the entire airspace can be determined as
the summation of the conflict counts for each sub-area, while taking into account
the interactions that occur between with different the sub-areas:

case the sum of the sizes of sub-areas 𝑖 and 𝑗 should be used.
It should be noted that the first summation term of equation 4.23 considers the
number of conflicts that occur in each of the sub-areas, whereas the second sum-
mationtermcomputesthenumberofconflictsthatoccurasaresultofinteractions
between aircraft in different sub-areas. This logic applies to both UA and layered
airspaces; the only difference for layered airspaces is that this approach should
be applied separately to the three flight phase combinations taken into account by
thecorrespondingbaselineanalyticalmodel,seeequation4.5. Adiscretizationinto

Once the location and number of sub-areas are identified, recursive programming
can be used to implement equation 4.23.
Heat-maps of the three spatial distributions considered in this study are pictured
in Figure 4.10. Here it can be seen that traffic density is relatively uniform within
the cylindrical ‘experiment region’ for the ‘ideal’ traffic scenario; see section 4.5.2

of the analytical and adjusted conflict count models for unstructured and layered
airspace designs, using traffic scenarios with varying speed, heading, altitude and
spatialdistributions. Thissectiondescribesthedesignoftheseexperiments.
4.5.1. Simulation Development
4.5.1.1. Simulation Platform
TheBlueSkyopen-sourceATMsimulatorwasusedasthesimulationplatforminthis
research. It was developed at the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) using
the Python programming language1. BlueSky has numerous features including the
abilitytosimulatemorethan5000aircraftsimultaneously,asuiteofconflictdetec-
tion and resolution algorithms, and extensive data logging functions. A complete
overview of BlueSky is provided in [108].
In order to simulate aircraft performance dynamics, BlueSky uses point-mass Air-
craft Performance Models (APMs) that are similar in structure to Eurocontrol’s well
known Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) models. The main difference between these
two approaches is that BlueSky uses openly available data to quantify the APMS.
To simplify the simulations, all traffic was simulated using a Boeing 744 model.
A full description of the BlueSky APMs, including their validation, can be found
in [109].
4.5.1.2. Conflict Detection
In this study, the so called ‘state-based’ conflict detection method was used. This
methodpredictsseparationviolationsbylinearlyextrapolatingaircraftpositionsover
a predefined look-ahead time. Here, a look-ahead time of 5 minutes, as well as
separationrequirementsof5nauticalmileshorizontallyand1000ftvertically,were
used.

4.5. Fast-Time Simulation Design 129
As mentioned in section 4.2.4, the models derived in this chapter are concerned
with the intrinsic safety provided by an airspace design. Since the notion of in-
trinsic safety focuses on the number of trulyoccurringconflicts as a function of
airspace design, conflict detection was performed assuming perfect knowledge of
aircraft states. For the same reason, the simulations were performed without tac-
tical conflict resolutions.
4.5.1.3. Airspace Concepts and Concept Implementation
UnstructuredAirspace(UA)andthreelayeredairspaceconcepts,eachwithadiffer-

Table 4.4 displays the properties of the considered airspace concepts, and also in-
dicates which concepts were used in each of the three experiments performed in

The airspace concepts were implemented into BlueSky by modifying its trajectory
planning functions. While direct horizontal routes were used in both unstructured
and layered airspaces, the method used to determine the cruising altitude of an
aircraft differed between the two airspace designs. For UA, the cruising altitude of
an aircraft, 𝑍 , was directly proportional to its trip distance, 𝐷:

4.5.2.1. Testing Region and Flight Profiles
A large three-dimensional en-route sector was used as the physical environment
for traffic simulations, see Figure 4.11. In the horizontal plane, the sector had a
square-shapedcross-sectionof400x400nauticalmiles. Intheverticaldimension,
the sector is divided into two parts; a ‘transition zone’ with a height of 4000 ft
for climbing and descending traffic, and a ‘cruising zone’ with a height of 7700
ft. Figure 4.11 also shows the horizontal and vertical flight profiles of an example
flight.

and simulation regions ensured that aircraft within the experiment region were
surrounded by traffic in all directions. Correspondingly, only aircraft within the
experiment region, and only conflicts with closest points of approach within the
experiment region, were used to assess the accuracy of the conflict count models.
The parameters of the experiment region needed to evaluate the models, as well
asotherparameterscommontoallfourexperiments,arelistedinTable4.5.
4.5.2.2. Traffic Demand Scenarios
A scenario generator was created to produce traffic scenarios with a desired and
constant traffic density. Constant density scenarios were used so that the number
of instantaneous conflicts logged during a simulation run could be attributed to
a particular traffic density. Since aircraft were deleted from the simulation as they
exitedthesector,torealizeconstantdensityscenarios,aircraftwereintroducedinto
thesimulationataconstantspawnrateequalto (cid:4949)̄ 𝑁,where𝑉̄ istheaveragespeed
(cid:4931)̄
of aircraft, 𝐷̄ is the average trip distance of aircraft, and 𝑁 is the desired number
of instantaneous aircraft. Using this approach, five traffic demand scenarios of
increasing density were defined, ranging between 5-100 aircraft per 10,000 NM(cid:4796)
in the simulation region. This corresponds to an instantaneous traffic demand of
between 80-1600 aircraft in the simulation region; see Table 4.6. Note that this
table displays the number of instantaneous aircraft in both the ‘simulation’ and
‘experiment’regions. Furthermore,fiverepetitions,representingfiverandominitial
conditions, were tested for each traffic demand condition.
It should be noted that all scenarios were generated off-line prior to the simula-
tions. Thisensuredthatallairspaceconceptscouldbesubjectedtothesametraffic

4.5.3. Independent Variables
Although the same five traffic demands were used for all experiments, the spe-
cific traffic patterns used varied between the four simulation experiments. This is
because each experiment focused on analyzing the effect of one particular traffic
scenario distribution on the accuracies of the baseline and adjusted conflict count
models, for both unstructured and layered airspaces. The follow paragraphs de-
scribe the traffic speed, heading, altitude and spatial distributions used by each
experiment.
4.5.3.1. Ground Speed Experiment
In this experiment, four different distributions were used to specify the ground
speedsofaircraft,seeFig.4.7. Allspeeddistributionshadameanspeedof400kts

experimentuseduniformheading,altitudeandspatialdistributions,andconsidered
the UA, L360, L180 and L90 concepts. This resulted in a total of 400 simulation
runs, involving over 1,000,000 flights.

4.5.3.3. Altitude Experiment
The altitude experiment considered the effect of the four altitude distributions dis-
played in Fig. 4.9 on conflict counts. For this experiment, the ground speed of all
aircraft equaled 400 kts, while the altitude and spatial distributions of traffic were

in a total of 200 simulation runs, with over 500,000 flights.
4.5.3.4. Spatial Experiment
The final experiment considered the effect of the spatial distribution of traffic on
conflict counts. Therefore, the simulations were performed for three different spa-
tial distributions; see Fig. 4.10. All spatial distributions were combined with traffic
scenarios that had a uniform distribution of headings and altitudes, and with an
equal ground speed of 400 kts for all traffic. This experiment was repeated for the
UA, L360, L180 and 190 concepts. This resulted in a total of 300 simulation, using
approximately 750,000 flights.

4.5.4. Dependent Variables
To determine the accuracy of both baseline and adjusted conflict count models,
modelpredictionswerecomparedtoactualconflictcountsloggedduringthesimu-
lations. Modelaccuracywasquantifiedbyintroducingamodelaccuracyparameter,
𝑘, as illustrated below:
No. of Inst. Conflicts = Gas Model × 𝑘
From the above, it can be seen that 𝑘 acts as a constant scaling parameter to the
models. Thevalueof𝑘isdeterminedbyfittingthemodelstothesimulationdatain
a least-square sense. A value of 𝑘 close to 1 indicates high model accuracy, while
𝑘 < 1 and 𝑘 > 1 indicates model over- and under-estimation of simulation data,
respectively. For easy analysis of the results, model accuracy is also computed
as a percentage by comparing the fitted 𝑘 value to a reference value of 1. Fur-
thermore, separate 𝑘 valuesarecomputed forthe analytical and ‘adjusted’ conflict
count models for each simulation condition.
Todeterminethevalueof𝑘usingleast-squares,duringthesimulations,thenumber
of instantaneous conflicts, and the number of instantaneous aircraft were logged
periodically every 15 seconds. Additionally only aircraft within the experiment re-
gion, and only conflicts with closest points of approach within the experiment re-
gion, were used to assess model accuracy. As mentioned earlier, this method for

toconsidertheperformanceofthebaselineanalyticalconflictcountmodelsforthe
‘ideal’ traffic scenario. For the ideal case, all traffic scenario characteristics match
the assumptions made during the derivation of the analytical models, i.e., all air-
craft are assumed to fly with equal ground speeds, with uniform heading, altitude
and spatial distributions. Therefore, the accuracies of the analytical models are
expected to the highest for the ideal scenario. The corresponding results for both
unstructured and layered airspaces are shown in Figure 4.12. In this figure, the
scatter points represent the raw simulation data, whereas the solid lines represent
thepredictionsoftheanalyticalmodels. Notethattherawsimulationdataappears
in 5 clusters since 5 traffic demand scenarios were used in the simulations, with
cluster representing data collected from all repetitions of a particular demand con-
dition;seeTable4.6. Additionally,modelaccuraciesarelistedinthetop-leftcorner
of this figure using the method described in section 4.5.4.
From Figure 4.12, it can be clearly seen that the baseline analytical model for UA,
described in section 4.3.1, closely approximates both the shape and the scaling of
the relationship between the number of instantaneous aircraft and the number of
instantaneous conflicts. In fact, model accuracy for UA was determined to be as
high as 97.6% for the ideal traffic scenario.

ens as the heading range per flight level, 𝛼, is decreased; accuracy decreases by
approximately 5% when 𝛼 is reduced from 360(cid:4968) to 90(cid:4968).
Theloweraccuraciesforlayeredairspaces,aswellasthereductionofaccuracyfor
smaller values of 𝛼, can be explained by considering the interaction between two
factors: thehigherproportionofconflictsinvolvingclimbing/descendingaircraftfor
layered airspaces, and the fact that no traffic was simulated above or below the
considered sector during the experiments.
Beforecontinuingwiththeexplanationfortheslightlylowermodelaccuraciesfound

Tothisend,Figure4.13displayserrorbarsforconflictcountscategorizedaccording
totheflightphasesofinteractingaircraft. Althoughthisfigureshowsthatareduc-
tion of 𝛼 reduces the total number of conflicts (red line), the number of conflicts
involvingclimbing/descendingtrafficis foundto be invariantwithairspace concept
(blueandvioletlines). Thisisbecausenoneoftheairspacedesignsconsideredhere
impose any constraints on the motion of climbing/descending traffic. Nonetheless,
as the total conflict count decreases without affecting the number of climbing/de-
scending conflicts, the relative importance of the latter conflict type increases for
layered airspaces.
Although climbing/descending aircraft have a greater influence on the intrinsic
safety of layered airspaces relative to UA, this fact by itself should not, in theory,
negatively affect the accuracies of the corresponding models. It does, however,
mean that climbing/descending conflicts have a larger weight on model accuracy
for layered airspaces. Instead, the lower accuracy for layered airspaces is caused
by the interaction between this fact and the design of the simulation experiments

To understand this interaction, it is necessary to consider the process of conflict
detection. Asmentionedpreviously,aircraftsearchforconflictswithinapredefined
region of airspace that can be decomposed into separate horizontal and vertical
‘conflict search volumes’; see Figure 4.4(b). For climbing and descending traffic,
theverticalconflict searchvolumecan extend beyondthe upper andlower bound-
ariesofthesimulatedsector. Sincenotrafficwassimulatedoutsidetheconsidered

bypreviousstudies[70,88],itisasyetunclearhowthesafetyperformanceofthese

additiontoquantifyingtheeffectsofscenariodistributionsontheaccuraciesofthe
analytical and adjusted conflict count models, the analysis that follows also exam-
ines whether the non-ideal traffic scenarios affect the relative safety differences
between UA and layered airspaces.
4.6.2. Ground Speed Experiment
The analytical conflict count models assume that all aircraft fly with equal ground
speed. Since this assumption deviates from realistic operations, the ground speed
experiment investigated the sensitivity of the analytical model to four speed distri-
butions displayed in Figure 4.7.
4.6.2.1. Effect of Speed Distribution on Conflict Counts
Before evaluating the effect of the equal speed assumption on model accuracy, it
is useful to compare the actual conflict count results for the four simulated speed
distributions. To this end, Figure 4.14 displays the means and the 95% confidence
intervalsofthenumberofconflictsloggedatthehighesttrafficdemandconditionfor
all speed distributions. Here it can be seen that speed distribution has a negligible
effect on conflict counts for all four airspace concepts considered in this study.
Furthermore, as the vertical spacing between the four concepts is unaffected by
changes in speed distribution, it can be concluded that speed distribution does

4.6. Results 137
notaltertherelativesafetydifferencesbetweenunstructuredandlayeredairspace
designs.
The invariance of conflict counts with ground speed distribution can be explained
by the fact that the same average ground speed is used by all four distributions.
Therefore, this result indicates that the average conflict probability between pairs
of aircraft, which is directly dependent on ground speed, is unaffected byshapeof
the ground speed distribution; instead, conflict probability is only affected by the
magnitude of the average ground speed of all aircraft in the airspace.
4.6.2.2. Effect of Speed Distribution on Model Accuracy

for both the analytical and adjusted models. Here it should be noted that the ana-
lyticalmodelwasevaluatedwhileassumingequalspeedsforallaircraft,regardless
of the actual distribution used in the simulation. As evidenced by Figure 4.14, Ta-
ble 4.7 indicates that the accuracy of the analytical model is unaffected by speed
distribution, and it remains very high for all airspace concepts. This trend was
hypothesized during the derivation of the ground speed model adjustment, where
it was found that the expected horizontal relative velocity was largely unaffected
by speed distribution; see Table 4.1. Nonetheless, the numerical ground speed
adjustment described by equation 4.14, which is also shown in Table 4.7 to have
produced high model accuracies, could be useful for layered airspaces with a very
narrowheadingrangeperflightlevel,i.e.,forlayeredconceptswith𝛼 <90(cid:4968),since
overtaking conflicts are more likely to occur for such airspace designs. The speed
model adjustment could also be required for cases where multiple traffic scenario
distributions are varied from their ideal settings, i.e., for the case where the speed
distribution is non-equal andthe heading/altitude/spatial distribution is also non-
uniform.

els for the four heading distributions pictured in Figure 4.8.
4.6.3.1. Effect of Heading Distribution on Conflict Counts
Figure 4.15 displays the effect of heading distribution on conflict counts for the
UA and L360 airspace concepts. Here it can be seen that conflict counts are the
highest when aircraft headings are uniformly distributed, i.e., for the distribution
assumed by the baseline analytical model. Although there are no significant dif-
ferences between the uniform and bimodal distributions, the normal and ranged
uniform distributions led to substantially lower conflict counts. These trends are
4
displayed by both UA and L360. Moreover, the relative safety differences between
thefourheadingdistributionsmatchtherelativedifferencesbetweentheexpected
horizontal relative velocity between aircraft, see Table 4.2. These results strongly
indicate that the heading distribution of traffic can have an effect on the intrinsic
safetyofunstructuredandlayeredairspaces;themagnitudeofthiseffectdepends
on the shape of the distribution used.

4.6.3.2. Effect of Heading Distribution on Model Accuracy
The model accuracy results for the heading experiment are listed in Table 4.8. As
suggested by Figure 4.15, for both UA and L360, the analytical models, which as-
sumes a uniform heading distribution for all simulation conditions, over-estimates
conflict counts when the actual headings in the simulation followed normal and
ranged-uniform distributions. This is indicated by 𝑘 values that are significantly
less than 1 for these two heading distributions. In addition to indicating the ac-
curacy of the models, the 𝑘 values computed for the analytical model can also be
used to compute the relative differences between conditions; for example, for UA,

4.6.4. Altitude Experiment
To evaluate the effect of altitude distribution conflict count model accuracy, in this
experiment, traffic simulations were conducted for the four altitude distributions
pictured in Figure 4.9.

Figure 4.16 displays the conflict count results of the altitude experiment. Here it
can be clearly seen that altitude distribution has a large impact on conflict counts

for both UA and L360. In contrast to the heading experiment, the uniform (alti-
tude) distribution condition, corresponding to the setting assumed by the baseline
analytical model, led to the lowest number of conflicts. On the other hand, the
ranged-uniform condition led to highest number of conflicts of all tested distribu-
tions. The figure also shows that changes in altitude distribution do not affect the
relative differences between unstructured and layered airspaces.
4.6.4.2. Effect of Altitude Distribution on Model Accuracy
The effect of altitude distribution on model accuracy is shown in Table 4.9. The
tableindicatesthattheanalyticalmodelsignificantlyunder-estimatesconflictcounts
(𝑘 >1) for all non-uniform altitude distributions for both airspace designs. This
resultisunsurprisinggiventhefactthattheuniformaltitudedistributionwasnoted
above to lead to the lowest number of conflicts of all studied conditions.
On the other hand, Table 4.9 indicates that model accuracies for the non-uniform
altitude conditions are much higher when the predictions of the adjustedconflict
count model are compared to logged simulation data. Nonetheless, in contrast to
the adjustments made to account for the speed and heading distributions of traf-
fic, the results for the altitude adjustment appears to be less consistent. This is
particularly the case for the L360 concept when aircraft altitudes follow normal or
bimodal distributions. These less consistent accuracy results can be attributed to
the fact that the model adjustment for aircraft altitudes only considers the vertical
distribution of cruising aircraft. Although the vast majority of aircraft in en route
airspaces are in the cruise phase of flight, the vertical distribution of climbing/de-
scending traffic will also affect the total conflict count in the airspace. However,
becausetherearealwaysmoreclimbing/descendingaircraftatloweraltitudes,the
vertical distribution of such aircraft is difficult to take into account since it always
differs from that of cruising aircraft. Despite this limitation, it is important to note
that the altitude related model adjustment derived in this work resulted in accura-

4.6.5. Spatial Experiment
While the previous experiment considered the effect of the vertical distribution
of traffic, this experiment investigated the effect of the horizontal distribution of
traffic on the accuracy of the analytical conflict count models. Correspondingly,
simulations were conducted for the three spatial distributions displayed in Fig-
ure 4.10.
4.6.5.1. Effect of Spatial Distribution on Conflict Counts
Unlike the other experiments, error-bars are not used to compare the conditions
of this experiment. This is because the scenarios with hot-spots resulted in much
higher traffic densities due to the fact that the hot-spot scenarios, by their very
nature,aimtocreatetrafficconcentrationswithinthe‘experimentregion’. Because
such density differences are not visible with error bars, the spatial conditions can
be compared instead using Figure 4.17. In this figure, the simulation data (scatter
points) is plotted together with the corresponding model fits(solid lines) for the
four airspace concepts considered in this experiment.

Figure4.17: Empiricalconflictcounts(scatterpoints)andmodelfits(solidline),spatialexperiment
The higher traffic densities for the hot-spot conditions are clearly evident in Fig-
ure 4.17; for all four concepts, the highest traffic demand scenario resulted in ap-
proximately 1100 instantaneous aircraft for the uniform spatial distribution, while
it is greater than 1400 instantaneous aircraft for the hot-spot conditions. Further-
more, this figure indicates that the hot-spots led to a significantly higher number
of conflicts, with hot-spot 2 resulting in the highest conflict count of all traffic sce-
nario distributions considered in this work. This strongly implies that the spatial
distribution of traffic can have a substantial effect on airspace safety.
4.6.5.2. Effect of Spatial Distribution on Model Accuracy
As expected, the model accuracy results for the spatial experiment, listed in Ta-
ble 4.10, indicate that the analytical model grossly under-estimated the number
of conflicts for the hot-spot conditions (k>1). On the other hand, model accuracy
is significantly improved for the adjusted models. For instance, for UA, the accu-
racy for hot-spot 2 increased from 48.1% for the analytical model to 98.2% for
the adjusted model. This indicates that the model adjustment procedure for the
spatialdistributionoftraffic,whichsegmentstheairspaceintoanumberofsmaller
areas, can be used to effectively improve conflict count model estimates for traffic
scenarios with non-uniform density distributions.

4.7. Discussion
Thischapterinvestigatedtheeffectofidealizedtrafficscenarioassumptionsonthe
accuracy of closed-form analytical conflict count models, often referred to as gas
models in literature. To this end, model predictions for unstructured and layered
airspacedesignswerecomparedwiththeresultsoffourfast-timesimulationexper-
iments with varying speed, heading, altitude, and spatial traffic distributions. Data
collectedfromthesesimulationswasalsousedtotestsocalled‘modeladjustments’
that aim to relax the dependency of the models on the idealized scenario assump-
tions. This section reflects on the intrinsic safety provided by unstructured and
layered airspaces for ‘non-ideal’ traffic scenarios, and discusses the accuracies of
the baseline analytical and adjusted conflict count models. Additionally, important
aspects related model usage are also considered. 4
4.7.1. EffectofTrafficScenarioonIntrinsicAirspaceSafety
Of the four traffic scenario distributions, the results showed that the altitude and
spatial distributions of traffic had the greatest impact on the number of conflicts.
Any deviation from the uniform altitude and spatial distributions assumed by the
baseline analytical model led to a significant increases in the number of conflicts,
with some spatial distributions leading to a doubling of conflict counts. While the
heading distribution also affected intrinsic safety, the magnitude of its effect was
strongly dependent on the shape of the distribution used. Moreover, in contrast to
the altitude and spatial cases, non-uniform heading distributions led to a decrease
in the number of conflicts. This is because non-uniform heading distributions gen-
erallyresultinoneormorepreferreddirectionsoftrafficflow,whichinturnreduce
the average relative velocities and average the conflict probabilities between air-
craft.
Ontheotherhand,variationsofthegroundspeeddistributiononlyresultedinminor
differencesinthenumberofinstantaneousconflicts. Althoughthisresultmayseem
surprising at first, it can be explained by considering the effect of ground speed
on the expected horizontal relative velocities between aircraft. The expected, or
weighted average, horizontal relative velocity in a given volume of airspace is de-
pendent on both the ground speedandthe heading distributions in that airspace.
Changes to the ground speed distribution, can therefore, be compensated for to
some extent by the specific heading distribution used. In this study, all ground
speed distributions were tested while using a uniform distribution of aircraft head-
ings,sincetheexperimentsperformedhereonlyvariedonetrafficscenarioproperty
at a time from the so called ‘ideal’ setting. As mentioned above, uniform heading
distributions resulted in the highest conflict counts by maximizing relative veloci-
ties. Asaresult,variationsofthegroundspeeddistributiondidnotyieldsignificant
changes to the expected horizontal relative velocities between aircraft, which in
turnreduceditseffectonconflictcounts. Itishypothesizedthatgroundspeeddis-
tribution could have a larger effect on the safety of layered airspace designs with

a very narrow heading range per flight level, and for scenarios with non-uniform
aircraft headings, since over-taking conflicts are more likely for such cases.
It should be noted that the trends discussed above were found for both unstruc-
tured and layered airspace designs. In fact, the relative differences between un-
structured and layered airspaces were unaffected by the twelve different traffic
scenarios that were tested in this work; unstructured airspace always resulted in
higher conflict counts than layered airspaces, and the intrinsic safety of layered
airspaces increased as the heading range per flight level was decreased. These
results indicate that traffic scenario properties do not fundamentally alter the be-
havior of an airspace design. They may, however, exacerbate conflict counts for
certain scenario distributions.
4
4.7.2. Accuracy of the Analytical and Adjusted
Conflict Count Models
Although the accuracy of the baseline analytical model for both airspace designs
was found to be very high for the ideal traffic scenario, accuracy was substan-
tially degraded when the underlying scenario assumptions were violated. Because
non-uniformaltitudeandspatialdistributionsledtothehighestconflictcounts,the
accuracy of the baseline models was the lowest for these scenario properties, with
some conditions resulting in accuracies as low as 50%, i.e., only half the actual
numberofconflictscouldbepredicted. Theonlyexceptiontothistrendwasfound
forthespeedexperiment,sincespeeddistributions,asmentionedabove,onlyhad
a minor effect on conflict counts. Nonetheless, these results indicate that the pre-
dictions of analytical conflict count models should be considered with caution for
non-ideal traffic scenarios.
In contrast, the accuracy of the numerically adjusted conflict count models was
foundtobeveryhighforalltestedscenarioconditions. Infact,formostcases,the
adjustedmodelsresultedinaccuraciesthatcloselymatchedthoseproducedbythe
baselineanalyticalmodelfortheidealtrafficsetting. Becausetheadjustmentsonly
affectthecomputationofcertaincomponentsofthemodels,thebasicstructureof
the adjusted models remains unchanged relative to the baseline analytical model.
Therefore, in addition to providing a physical understanding of the parameters,
and the relationships between the parameters, that affect intrinsic airspace safety,
the adjusted models can be used to compute the highly accurate conflict count
estimates necessary for practical airspace design applications.
4.7.3. Additional Considerations
Model adjustments have been derived in this study on an individual basis for each
of the four traffic scenario assumptions. However, it should be noted that the four
adjustments do not exclude each other, and therefore, multiple adjustments can
be applied at the same time for cases where two or more traffic scenario proper-
ties deviate from their ideal settings. On a similar note, for mathematical conve-

4.8. Conclusions 147
nience, model adjustments have been tested here using relatively straightforward
scenario distributions. Nevertheless, due to the numerical nature of all model ad-
justments, they can also be applied to other untested traffic scenarios, as long as
thecharacteristicsoftheunderlyingdistributionsareknown,orcanbedetermined
empirically.
This chapter has focused on analyzing and generalizing conflict count models for
unstructured and layered airspace designs. The methods presented here to gen-
eralize the models can, however, be extended to other airspace designs. This is
because all gas models can be described as a product of two factors, namely the
number of combinations of two aircraft, and the average conflict probability be-
tween any two aircraft. The model adjustments derived here have considered the
effectsofnon-idealtrafficscenariosonboththesefactors. Assuch,‘adjusted’con-
4
flict count models can be developed for other airspace designs using the approach
outlinedinthischapter,includingforairspaceconceptsthatareclosertoday’smode

4.8. Conclusions
This chapter analyzed the effect of traffic scenario properties on the accuracy of
gasmodelinspiredanalyticalconflictcountmodelsthathavebeenusedinthepast
to quantify the intrinsic safety provided by an airspace design. These analytical
models were derived using idealized assumptions regarding the speed, heading,
altitude and spatial distributions of traffic. The sensitivity of the analytical models
to these assumptions was evaluated using four fast-time simulation experiments
within the context of unstructured and layered airspace designs. Data from these
simulations was also used to derive and test so called ‘model adjustments’ that

5.1. Introduction
Despite the significant research and development efforts undertaken to overhaul
aging Air Traffic Control (ATC) systems over the past decade, air traffic delays and
congestion continue to rise at an alarming rate [12, 16, 17]. In response to this
pressing issue, several researchers have advocated for a transfer of traffic separa-
tion responsibilities from ground based Air Traffic Controllers (ATCos) to each indi-
vidual aircraft [30, 91–93]. The resulting decentralized traffic separation paradigm
is expected to increase airspace capacity over current centralized operations by
providing more flexing routing to aircraft operators, and thereby increasing the
efficiency with which the available airspace is utilized.
Tosupportdecentralization,theresearchcommunityhaslargelyfocusedonthede-
velopmentofautomatedalgorithmsforConflictDetectionandResolution(CD&R)[49,
111–113]. Some studies in this domain have also investigated if such algorithms
can be combined with different options for structuring traffic to further improve
capacity over todays operations [57, 74, 114].

--- Page 172 ---

5.1. Introduction 153
However, in spite of over two decades of active research highlighting its theorized
benefits,aswellassuccessfultestflightsoverMediterraneanairspace[63],decen-
tralization is yet to be deployed in the field. From a technical point of view, one
possible reason for the reluctance to introduce decentralization may be explained
bythefactthatmostcurrentcapacitymeasurementtools,suchasthoserelatedto
ATCo workload, are not relevant for decentralized ATC. The absence of such tools
has made it difficult to quantitatively analyze and compare the capabilities of the
proposed decentralized airspace concepts and CD&R algorithms.
Butbeforeacomprehensivecapacityassessmentmethodcanbedevelopedforde-
centralized ATC, it is first necessary to consider what the term ‘airspace capacity’
referstoinamoregeneralsense. Atafundamentallevel,airspacecapacity,regard-
less of the type or location separation management, can be considered equivalent
to the density at which the airspace becomes saturated, i.e., the density beyond
which no additional traffic can be accommodated without significantly degrading
system-wide macroscopic properties, properties such as the safety and efficiency
of travel.
5
Usingthisviewofairspacecapacityasastartingpoint,previousresearchhasiden-
tified airspace stability, which considers the propagation of conflicts as a result of
tactical Conflict Resolution (CR) maneuvers, as an important factor when evaluat-
ing the saturation density of decentralized ATC concepts [32, 33]. These studies
haveshownthatCRcandestabilizetheairspaceathightrafficdensitiesbytrigger-
ing conflict chain reactions due to the scarcity of airspace, as well as due to the
airspace design and CD&R algorithms used. To measure airspace stability, liter-
ature has presented the so called Domino Effect Parameter (DEP). The DEP was
subsequentlyused byJardinto relateairspacestabilityto airspacecapacityforde-
centralization [28, 29]. Although Jardin’s method provides an innovative approach
formeasuringcapacity,itusesanoversimplifiedandinaccuratemethodtocompute
theexpectedrelativevelocitybetweenaircraft,whichisakeyparameterofthisap-
proach. Additionally, Jardin’s method is only applicable for the case where motion
is restricted to the horizontal plane. Therefore the method, as derived previously,
doesnotaccountfortheeffectsofclimbinganddescendingtrafficoncapacity. The
lattershortcomingseverelylimitstheapplicationofJardin’smethod,particularlyas
recent studies have indicated that climbing/descending traffic have a substantial
impact on the safety of certain airspace configurations [88, 110].
In response to this limitation, the main goal of this chapter is to generalize the
method proposed by Jardin, and to extend it for application in three-dimensional
airspacessuchthethateffectsofallaircraftflightphasesoncapacitycanbetaken
into account. Additionally, we have used our past experiences in developing and
validating analytical models that compute the expected relative velocity between
aircraft as a function of airspace design to increase the accuracy and the realism
ofthemethod[88]. Theresultingimprovedmethod,termedhereCapacityAssess-
ment Method for Decentralized ATC, or CAMDA for short, makes use of the DEP to
define the maximumtheoreticalcapacityof decentralized airspace designs as the
densityatwhichconflictchainreactionsbecomeuncontrollable. Inotherwords,at

154 5. Capacity Assessment Method for Decentralized ATC
the capacity limit, all aircraft exists in a persistent state of conflict, because every
conflict resolution action leads to an infinite number of new conflicts. Although
the theoretical capacity limit cannot be realized in practice, it can be used as an
unbiased metric to compare different airspace designs and/or CD&R algorithms in
terms of capacity.
Because conflict chain reactions are caused by many interconnected factors that
cannotbeaccuratelydescribedforallconditionsinapurelyanalyticalsense,CAMDA
is a semi-empirical approach. Therefore CAMDA relies on empirical data, obtained
through simulation, to apply its capacity definition, and to evaluate the capacity
of a particular airspace design and CD&R algorithm combination. Nonetheless,
because the underlying CAMDA models take into account the constraints imposed
byairspacedesignconcepts,andarebasedontheprocessesthatgovernCD&R,all
itsparametershavephysicalmeaning. Assuch,thestructureoftheCAMDAmodels

for decentralized tactical conflict resolution. The five experiments investigate how
airspace capacity is affected by a) differences between unstructured and layered
airspacedesigns;b)conflictdetectionparameters;c)conflictresolutiondimension;

This chapter begins with a summary of the relevant background material in sec-
tion 5.2. Subsequently, in section 5.3, the complete derivation of the CAMDA
method is presented for both unstructured and layered airspaces. Section 5.4 de-
scribes the design of the simulation experiments that are used to demonstrate the

the main conclusions of this study are listed in section 5.7.

This section provides an overview of the definitions and background material used
by the CAMDA method. Additionally, descriptions of the conceptual designs of un-

are provided.
5.2.1. Conflicts vs. Intrusions
A conflict occurs if the horizontal and vertical distances between two aircraft are
expected to be less than the prescribed separation standards within a predeter-
mined ‘look-ahead’ time. Conflicts are, therefore, predictions of futureseparation

violations. Conflicts should not be confused with intrusions. Instead, intrusions,
also referred to as losses of separation, occur when separation requirements are

violated at the presenttime. This distinction between conflicts and intrusions is
shown in Figure 5.1.

to conflicts.
5.2.2. Airspace Stability and the Domino Effect
Parameter
Airspace stability relates to the occurrence of conflict chains due to tactical Con-
flict Resolution (CR) maneuvers. At high traffic densities, such chain reactions can
‘destabilize’ the airspace by propagating conflicts throughout the entire airspace.
Tomeasurethepropagationofconflictchainreactions,literatureintroducestheso
called ‘Domino Effect Parameter’ (DEP) [32, 33]. The DEP can be visualized using
the Venn diagram pictured in Figure 5.2. Here, 𝐶 is the set of all conflicts
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
without CR, and 𝐶 is the set of all conflicts with CR, for identical traffic sce-
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4976)(cid:4971)
narios. Furthermore,threeregionscanbeidentifiedinFig.5.2;𝑅1,𝑅2and𝑅3. By
comparing 𝑅3 with 𝑅1, the proportion of ‘destabilizing’ conflicts caused by CR can
be determined. Thus, the DEP is defined as:

To interpret the output of the above equation, it is useful to categorize conflicts in
𝑅 ,𝑅 ,and𝑅 subsets. First,conflictsthatarecommontoboththeCROFFandCR
(cid:4795) (cid:4796) (cid:4797)
ON cases aregivenby 𝑅 . However, as soon as CR is applied, the aircraftthat suf-
(cid:4796)
fer conflicts will fly different routes, both spatially and temporally. Because of this,
5
some conflicts that would have occurred with the original CR OFF trajectories will
be avoided, and similarly, the altered CR ON trajectories can also trigger different
conflicts. In Figure 5.2, 𝑅 represents the avoided conflicts, and 𝑅 corresponds
(cid:4795) (cid:4797)
to the additional, different conflicts, with CR ON. These additional conflicts can be
either due to chance, or due to chain reactions, where a conflict resolution of a
primaryconflict immediately triggers asecondary, or knock-on, conflict. Therefore
it follows that the numerator, 𝑅 −𝑅 , indicates the amount by which the num-
(cid:4797) (cid:4795)
ber of additional conflicts outweighs the number of conflicts that are avoided with
CR, and as such, the net destabilizing effect of CR (or stabilizing if 𝑅 > 𝑅 ). If
(cid:4795) (cid:4797)
it is assumed that conflict probability doesn’t change due to CR, the numberof
primaryconflictscanbeconsideredequivalentto 𝐶 , i.e., thedenominatorof
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
the above equation1. Consequently, based on the structure of equation 5.1, the
DEP can be thought of as the numberofsecondaryconflictsperprimaryconflict.
Correspondingly, a higher value of DEP indicates higher airspace instability.
As the DEP is concerned with conflict chains, it is invariably linked to the safety of
theairspace. Butbecauseconflictchainreactionsalsoincreasetheflightdistances
ofaircraft,theDEP,andconsequentlythenotionofairspaceairspacestability, also
relatestoairspaceefficiency. Theabilitytosimultaneouslyconsiderboththesafety
and efficiency of air travel makes the DEP a powerful tool for airspace capacity
analysis purposes.

can in turn reduce traffic concentrations and ensuing delays [29, 30].
5.2.4. The ‘Layers’ Airspace Design Concept
Several different layered airspace concepts have been discussed in literature [95–
97]. The specific variation under consideration in this work was developed in our
prior work [74], and is known as the ‘Layers’ concept.
The Layers concept can be seen as an extension to the hemispheric/semicircular
rule [79]. In this concept, the airspace is segmented into vertically stacked bands,
and heading-altitude rules are used to limit the range of travel directions allowed
5
in each altitude layer. Although the Layers concept dictates the vertical profile of a
flight,operatorsarefreetoselectdirecthorizontalrouteswhenpossible. Moreover,
climbing and descending aircraft are exempted from the heading-altitude rules,
and can violate them to reach their cruising altitude or destination. This exception
avoids inefficient ‘spirals’ when climbing/descending.

Therefore,thealtitudebandsoftheLayersconceptsconsideredhereareseparated

by𝜁 =1100ft;theextra100ftisusedtopreventsocalled‘false’conflictsthatcan
sometimes occur due to any slight overshooting of altitude when aircraft level-off
at their desired flight level. Such an offset is also necessary to account for any
height-keeping errors, and because of turbulence.
The second design parameter of the Layers concept is the heading range allowed
per altitude band, 𝛼. For the layered airspace shown in Figure 5.3, 𝛼 = 45(cid:4968), and
thus eight flight levels are needed to define one complete ‘set’ of layers. Corre-
spondingly, for a layered design with 𝛼 = 90(cid:4968), only four flight levels would be
needed to specify all possible travel directions. Therefore, for 𝛼 = 90(cid:4968), two com-
plete ‘sets’ of layers would fit within the volume of airspace needed for 𝛼 = 45(cid:4968).
When multiple sets of layers are available, the total trip distance of an aircraft is
used in addition to its heading to determine its cruising altitude. In this way, short
flights can use lower layer sets, and longer flights can use higher layer sets, to
reduce the negative effect of predetermined altitudes on flight efficiencies.
PreviousresearchhasfoundthatlayeredairspacesaresaferthanUA,andthatthe
5 safety of layered airspaces increase as 𝛼 is decreased [118]. One of the goals of
this chapter is to determine whether the maximum theoretical capacity of layered
airspaces also follows these trends.
5.3. The CAMDA Method
This section presents the complete derivation of the CAMDA method. It begins by
introducing the airspace capacity definition used by CAMDA. This definition is sub-
sequentlyusedtoderivecomponentsoftheCAMDAapproachforbothunstructured
and layered airspace designs.
5.3.1. CAMDA Capacity Definition
When a conflict is detected, a conflict resolution action needs to be taken to pre-
vent that conflict from turning into an intrusion. In the case of decentralized ATC,
these resolutions can be determined by pilots and/or by automated onboard CR
algorithms. In either case, such tactical CR maneuvers can cause new conflicts,
andinsomecases,theycantriggerconflictchainreactions. Atlowtrafficdensities,
theamplemaneuveringroomavailablewould,undernormalconditions,allowsuch
chainreactionstodissipatebythemselves,i.e.,withoutexternalintervention.
When extrapolating this logic for extreme traffic densities, it is likely that at a crit-
ical traffic density, the scarcity of airspace becomes so severe that conflict chain
reactions propagate throughout the entire airspace. This would cause all aircraft
to be inter-connected by a continuous, and perpetual conflict chain. Under such
circumstances, it is unlikely that any CR maneuver by any aircraft could stabilize
the airspace system. This would in turn result in an uncontrollable situation where
allaircraftareresignedtocontinuallyperformmeaninglessCRmaneuvers,without
everbeingabletosolveanyconflictsorflytotheiractualdestinations. TheCAMDA

5.3. The CAMDA Method 159
method defines the maximum theoreticalcapacity of a decentralized airspace de-
sign at this critical traffic density.
To pin-point the aforementioned hypothetical density at which conflict chain reac-
tionsbecomeuncontrollable,CAMDAmakesuseoftheDEP;ifallaircraftare‘stuck’
inconflictatthemaximumtheoreticaldensity,thenitfollowsthataninfinitenumber
of secondary conflicts would be triggered by the resolution of any primary conflict.
Therefore, CAMDA defines the maximumtheoreticalcapacityof the airspace as
the traffic density at which the rate of change of the DEP with density approaches
infinity. More formally, the CAMDA capacity definition can be stated as:
𝑑𝐷𝐸𝑃(𝜌)
lim =∞, where 𝜌 ≡capacity (5.2)
(cid:5022)→(cid:5022)(cid:5214)(cid:5202)(cid:5225) 𝑑𝜌 (cid:4966)(cid:4954)(cid:4977)
Itshouldbenotedthatunlikecurrentlyusedcapacitymetrics,whichmainlyfocuson
throughput,CAMDAmeasurescapacityasthesaturationdensityoftheairspace. As
5
mentionedabove,thissaturationdensityisdefinedfromtheperspectiveofairspace
stability. Therefore,capacity,asdefinedhere,doesn’treflecttheoperationalcapac-
ityofanairspace,butcanbeusedinsteadtocomparedifferent(airspace)concepts
with each other.
5.3.2. CAMDA Framework
ToevaluatetheCAMDAcapacitydefinitiongivenbyequation5.2,itisnecessaryto
express the DEP as a function of 𝜌. As indicated by equation 5.1, this requires the
derivation of models for 𝐶 and 𝐶 as functions of 𝜌. CAMDA derives
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4967)(cid:4971) (cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4976)(cid:4971)
such expressions using a six-step sequential framework, see Figure 5.4. Here it
can be seen that the framework consists of two main parts. The first part focuses
on modeling 𝐶 , while the second focuses on modeling 𝐶 . Two as-
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4967)(cid:4971) (cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4976)(cid:4971)
sumptions,shownontheleftsideofFigure5.4,areusedtobridgethesetwomain
parts of the framework. The final step uses these models, and applies the CAMDA
capacity definition to determine the maximum theoretical capacity, 𝜌 , via the
(cid:4966)(cid:4954)(cid:4977)
DEP.
Before proceeding with the derivation of the CAMDA model components, it is nec-
essary to highlight three aspects.
Firstly, it should be noted that CAMDA is inspired by Jardin [28, 29]. In addi-
tion to formalizing Jardin’s approach, this chapter extends his method for three-
dimensionalairspace,andappliesittodeterminethecapacityofbothunstructured
andlayeredairspacesdesignsforanumberofconditions,seesection5.4.3formore
detailsonthespecificexperimentconditionsconsideredinthiswork. Furthermore,
because CAMDA relies on a sequential framework, by using improved models for
the first step of the CAMDA framework using results from our prior work [70, 88],
theaccuracyandrealismofallsubsequentstepsisalsoexpectedtobehigherthan
in [28, 29].

--- Page 179 ---

160 5. Capacity Assessment Method for Decentralized ATC
Secondly, it should be noted that CAMDA is a semi-empirical method as one of its
parameters needs to be determined directly from simulation data. This is because
conflictchainreactions,whicharecentraltotheCAMDAcapacitydefinition,arede-
pendent on a number inter-linked factors, and the effects of these interactions on
capacity are difficult to model accurately using a purely analytical approach [119].
These include emergent behavior that results from interactions between the con-
sidered CD&R algorithms and the selected airspace design.
Finally, as stated previously, this work aims at demonstrating CAMDA for three-
dimensional unstructured and layered airspace designs that are combined with a
state-based CD algorithm, and a voltage potential-based CR algorithm. Hence the
specificmodels,asderivedhere,areonlyapplicableforthesetwoairspacedesigns,
and, to some extent, in combination with this particular CD&R algorithm. Never-
theless, the basic framework displayed in Figure 5.4 can be applied to any given
decentralizedairspacedesign. BecauseCAMDAissequential,anyadaptationsalong
theselinesmostlyinvolvesmakingappropriatemodificationstothefirststepofthe
CAMDA framework.

5.3.3. Unstructured Airspace
The following paragraphs present the complete derivation of the six CAMDA steps
for Unstructured Airspace (UA).
5.3.3.1. Step 1: Instantaneous Conflict Count Without
Conflict Resolution
To be able to compute the total number of conflicts without CR, 𝐶 , it is
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
necessarytofirstmodelthenumberofinstantaneousconflictsintheentireairspace
without CR, 𝐶 , as a function of the number of instantaneous aircraft in the
(cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
airspace without CR, 𝑁 . Subsequently, in the second step of the derivation,
(cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
the model for 𝐶 will be integrated over time to calculate 𝐶 .
(cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4967)(cid:4971) (cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
For any airspace design, 𝐶 can be modeled as the product of two factors,
(cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
namely the number of combinations of two aircraft, and the conflict probability
5 betweenanytwoaircraft,𝑝. Inessence,thenumberofcombinationsoftwoaircraft
isthemaximumnumberofconflictsthatcanoccur,sincemulti-aircraftconflicts,i.e.,
conflicts involving more than two aircraft, can also be decomposed into a series of
two-aircraft conflicts. The conflict probability, on the other hand, scales down the
numberofcombinationssothatonlythoseaircraftpairsthatarepredictedtoviolate
separation requirements within the conflict detection look-ahead time are counted
as conflicts.
For UA, the number of combinations can be computed directly using the binomial
theorem, since this airspace design imposes no constraints on the motion of air-
craft [70, 88]. Therefore, 𝐶 can be expressed as:
(cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)(cid:5196)(cid:5176)
𝑁 𝑁 (𝑁 −1)
(cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4967)(cid:4971) (cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4967)(cid:4971) (cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
𝐶 =( ) 𝑝 = 𝑝 (5.3)
(cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)(cid:5196)(cid:5176) 2 (cid:5196)(cid:5176) 2 (cid:5196)(cid:5176)
To model conflict probability for UA, 𝑝 , it is necessary to consider the process of
(cid:5196)(cid:5176)
CD.MostpreviousstudiesondecentralizedATChavetheusedsocalledstate-based
CD algorithm. In state-based CD, aircraft search for conflicts within a volume of
airspace in front of them. In essence, this involves a 4D extrapolation of aircraft
position vectors overa predetermined ‘look-ahead’ time, 𝑡 , assuming constant ve-
(cid:4965)
locityvectors. Aconflictissaidhaveoccurrediftheextrapolatedpathofananother
aircraft is predicted to pass through the slanted ‘conflict search cylinder’ pictured
in Figure 5.5(a) within 𝑡 .. Since there are no constraints on aircraft motion in UA,
(cid:4965)
conflictscanoccurbetweenaircraftinanyflightphaseinUA.Therefore,𝑝 canbe
(cid:5196)(cid:5176)
computed as the ratio between the volume of airspace searched for conflicts, 𝐵 ,
(cid:4956)
andthetotalvolumeoftheairspaceunderconsideration,𝐵 . Formathematical
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965)
convenience, 𝐵 can be decomposed into its horizontal and vertical components,
(cid:4956)
see Figure 5.5(b). Using this approach, 𝑝 as can be expressed as:
(cid:4974)(cid:4954)

equivalenttotheweightedaverageoftherelativevelocityofallaircraftpairsinthe
airspace, taking into account the heading, altitude, spatial and speed distributions
of all aircraft. For UA, we have derived the following expressions for these two
variables in our prior work [88]:

(cid:4971),(cid:4975) (cid:4968)
(cid:5196)(cid:5176)
Here, 𝑉 is average ground speed of all aircraft in an airspace, 𝛾 is the flight path
(cid:4968)
angle of climbing/descending aircraft, and 𝜀 is the proportion of cruising aircraft in
the airspace, i.e, 𝜀 = 𝑁 /𝑁 , where 𝑁 is the number of instan-
(cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4956)(cid:4971),(cid:4967)(cid:4971) (cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4967)(cid:4971) (cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4956)(cid:4971),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)

Note that the derivation of the above equations for the expected relative veloci-
ties decomposes aircraft trajectories into cruising, climbing and descending flight
phases. Whileadditionalflightphasescanbetakenintoaccountbytheunderlying
derivationprocedure,asegmentationintothesethreeflightphasesisconsideredto

derivation. Furthermore, the specific version of equations 5.4 and 5.5 apply only
for traffic scenarios with uniform heading, altitude, and spatial distributions. They
also assume that all aircraft fly with equal ground speeds. Because CAMDA is a
sequential method, these assumptions affect subsequent steps of the derivation.
Nevertheless, the effect of the equal speed assumption on CAMDA is specifically
tested in this research, see section 5.5.5. The reader is referred to [110] for alter-
nate expected relative velocity expressions for cases where the above ‘ideal’ traffic
scenario assumptions do not hold.
5.3.3.2. Step2: TotalConflictCountWithoutConflictResolution
The total number of conflicts without CR, 𝐶 , can be computed by summing
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
up the number of instantaneous conflicts detected at each time step during an
analysis time interval 𝑇. The result of this summation should be divided by the
average conflict duration, 𝑡 , so that conflicts which occur over multiple time steps
(cid:4956)
are only counted once. Since a continuous summation over time is equivalent to
5 an integration over time, a model for 𝐶 can be computed as:
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
1 (cid:4947)
𝐶 = ∫ 𝐶 𝑑𝑇
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4967)(cid:4971) 𝑡 (cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
(cid:4956) (cid:4794) (5.6)
𝐶 𝑇
(cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
=
𝑡
(cid:4956)
To introduce traffic density, 𝜌, into the derivation process, the following simple
relationship between the number of instantaneous aircraft, 𝑁 , and the total
(cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
area of the airspace, 𝐴 , can be used:
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965)

𝜌= (5.7)

(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965)
ForUA,substitutionofequations5.3and5.7intoequation5.6leadstothefollowing
final expression for 𝐶 :
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)(cid:5196)(cid:5176)
𝐶 = 𝑝 (cid:5196)(cid:5176) 𝜌 𝑇 𝐴(cid:4796) (cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965) (𝜌− (cid:4928)(cid:5221)(cid:5216) (cid:4795) (cid:5221)(cid:5202)(cid:5213) ) ≈ 𝑝 (cid:5196)(cid:5176) 𝜌(cid:4796) 𝑇 𝐴(cid:4796) (cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965) if 𝜌≫ 1 (5.8)

(cid:4956) (cid:4956) (cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965)
Note that the above equation has been simplified using the fact that 𝜌−1/𝐴 ≈ 𝜌
for practical values of 𝜌 and 𝐴. Also note that under ideal conditions, 𝑡 is equal to
(cid:4956)
the look-ahead time, 𝑡 , for state-based CD. However, simulation artifacts, such as
(cid:4965)

5.3.3.3. Step 3: Local Conflict Count Per Unit Distance
Without Conflict Resolution
WhilethepreviousstepsoftheCAMDAframeworkhaveconsideredconflictcounts
for all traffic in the airspace (global), this step focuses on determining conflict
counts, and conflict counts per unit distance flown, for a singleaircraftwithout

Note that the CAMDA method considers 𝐷 to be a known input parameter. To
(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
express 𝐶(cid:5539) as a function of 𝜌, a model for 𝑁 as a function of 𝜌 is needed.
(cid:4795),(cid:4967)(cid:4971) (cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
This can be derived as follows; to maintain a constant density of one aircraft in
an airspace, the aircraft replacement rate would have to be 𝑉/𝐷 . Likewise,
(cid:4968) (cid:4967)(cid:4971)
to maintain a density of 𝑁 aircraft, the replacement rate would have to be

𝑁 ⋅𝑉/𝐷 . Correspondingly,thetotalnumberofaircraftintroducedduringan

analysis interval of length 𝑇 would be 𝑇⋅𝑁 ⋅𝑉/𝐷 . By using equation 5.7,
(cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4967)(cid:4971) (cid:4968) (cid:4967)(cid:4971)
and the logic described here, 𝑁 can be formulated as:

that started their flights during the analysis time interval, while the second term is

and 5.11 into equation 5.10:

5.3.3.4. Step 4: Local Conflict Count Per Unit Distance With Conflict
Resolution
While the last three derivationsteps considered the casewithoutCR, the following
three steps focus on conflict modelingwithCR. Modeling the case with CR begins
by developing an expression for the local conflict count per unit distance with CR,
𝐶(cid:5539) , i.e., the ‘with CR’ counterpart of the previous step.
(cid:4795),(cid:4976)(cid:4971)
To model 𝐶(cid:5539) , consider the motion of traffic within a decentralized system. In
(cid:4795),(cid:4976)(cid:4971)
such a system, it is possible that there are no preferred directions, or because of
a popular destination(s), there can be one or more preferred directions. Regard-

less of the type of heading distribution, CR maneuvers by a single aircraft, or by
multiple aircraft in different parts of the airspace, are unlikely to affect the shape
oftheoverallheadingdistributionofthetotalairspace. Becausethislogiccanalso
be applied to all other traffic scenario distributions, such the altitude and spatial
distributionoftraffic,Jardinassumesthatthenumberofconflictsperunitdistance
does not vary substantially with and without CR [28, 29]. More formally, the first
assumption used by CAMDA can be stated as:
CAMDAAssumption1
Thelocalconflictrateperunitdistanceisunaffectedbytacticalconflictresolution
maneuvers,i.e.,𝐶(cid:5539) =𝐶(cid:5539)
(cid:4795),(cid:4976)(cid:4971) (cid:4795),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
Using assumption 1 and equation 5.12, 𝐶(cid:5539) for UA can be written as:
(cid:4795),(cid:4976)(cid:4971)
𝑝 𝜌 𝑇 𝐴
𝐶(cid:5539) = (cid:5196)(cid:5176) (cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965) (5.13)

validity of this assumption, and its effect on the final CAMDA capacity assessment,

Asstatedbefore,tocomputetheDEP,itisnecessarytoderiveamodelofthetotal
number of conflicts in an airspace with CR, 𝐶 . This can be computed by

(cid:4795),(cid:4976)(cid:4971)
which can in turn be expressed as the product of the average flight distance with
CR, 𝐷 , and the local conflict count per unit distance with CR, 𝐶(cid:5539) :

(cid:4795),(cid:4976)(cid:4971) (cid:4976)(cid:4971) (cid:4795),(cid:4976)(cid:4971)
Although 𝐶(cid:5539) was assumed to be not affected by CR, see assumption 1, this
(cid:4795),(cid:4976)(cid:4971)
can not be assumed for 𝐷 (cid:4976)(cid:4971) . This is because CR maneuvers cause aircraft to 5
deviate from their original paths, and these deviations will typically increase the
total distance flown (and/or the total flight time) relative to the case without CR,
regardlessoftheactualCRalgorithmused2;seeFigure5.6. Therefore,𝐷 canbe
(cid:4976)(cid:4971)
expressed as:
𝐷 =𝐷 +𝐷 𝐶 (5.15)
(cid:4976)(cid:4971) (cid:4967)(cid:4971) (cid:4956)(cid:4957)(cid:4971) (cid:4795),(cid:4976)(cid:4971)
The above equation states that the distance flown by an aircraft with CR increases
with the number of conflicts detected. Here, the ‘extra’ distance flown as result of
each conflict resolution maneuver, including the extra distance flown by an aircraft
to recover its pre-conflict destination/waypoint, is denoted as 𝐷 . As mentioned
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)(cid:4971)
above, this parameter is primarily affected by the type of CD&R algorithm used,
since the selected CD&R algorithm has a large influence on the initial deviation
neededtoresolveconflicts. Forthisreason,𝐷 isalsoheavilyimpactedbyconflict
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)(cid:4971)
chain reactions, because such conflict chain reactions increase the average devia-
tion required to resolve conflicts. In addition to these two aspects, 𝐷 is also af-

(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4976)(cid:4971)
CR is expected to increase 𝜌 due to longer flights, CR is also expected to increase
the average distance flown by a proportional amount. Thus, the total number of
aircraft during the analysis time interval is assumed to be similar with and without
CR, as can be seen when this logic is applied to equation5.11. More formally, the
5 second assumption used by the CAMDA framework can be stated as:
CAMDAAssumption2

Using assumption 2 and equation 5.11, 𝑁 can be written as:

As for assumption 1, the validity of assumption 2 is also tested is tested using

To apply the CAMDA capacity definition, it is useful to collect together all terms

defined as:

Using equation 5.21, equation 5.20 can be simplified as:

TheCAMDAcapacitydefinition,givenbyequation5.2,cannowbeevaluated. This
involves determining the density at which the rate of change of the DEP with 𝜌
equals infinity:
𝑑𝐷𝐸𝑃 𝜂 𝜇

Based on the structure of equation 5.23, it can be seen that the rate of change

the above equation indicates that 𝜌 is dependent on the extra distance flown

CAMDA framework for layered airspaces.
5.3.4.1. Step 1: Instantaneous Conflict Count Without
Conflict Resolution
5 The altitude constraints imposed by the Layers concept reduces the number of
conflicts between cruising aircraft relative to UA. However, there no procedural

and between climbing/descending aircraft, respectively, without CR. These three

ConflictsBetweenCruisingAircraft
SincetheverticalspacingbetweenthepredefinedflightlevelsoftheLayersconcept
is, by definition, at least to the vertical separation requirement, cruising aircraft in
different flight levels can not conflict with each other; see section 5.2.4. This in
turn reduces the number of possible conflict pairs for cruising aircraft. If aircraft
are uniformly distributed over all available flight levels, 𝐿, then the number of in-
stantaneous cruising conflicts without CR can be computed as [70, 88]:

In the above equation, E(𝑉 ) is the expected horizontal relative velocity be-

ConflictsBetweenCruisingandClimbing/DescendingAircraft
Because the Layers concept imposes no constraints to prevent conflicts between
cruising and climbing/descending traffic, the model for 𝐶 is very similar
(cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4956)(cid:4971)(cid:4805)(cid:4956)(cid:4957),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
to the corresponding model developed for UA, given by equations5.3-5.5, except
for two minor differences:
1. The number of combinations of cruising and climbing/descending aircraft is
𝑁 ⋅ 𝑁 . This is because an aircraft can not be cruising and
(cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4956)(cid:4971),(cid:4967)(cid:4971) (cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4956)(cid:4957),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
climbing/descending at the same time.

The model describing the number of instantaneous conflicts between climbing/de-
scending traffic, 𝐶 , is also similar to that derived earlier for UA. In this case, the
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)
only difference is in the computation of the expected vertical relative velocity be-

(cid:4971),(cid:4975) (cid:4956)(cid:4957)

it would be interesting is to determine what effect the heading-altitude rules and

designs from UA, have on the maximum theoretical capacity of the airspace. This
is one of the goals of this study.

5.4. Fast-Time Simulation Design
This section describes the design of five fast-time simulation experiments that
demonstratetheusageoftheCAMDAmethod. Theseexperimentswereperformed
inthecontextofunstructuredandlayeredairspacedesigns,andconsideredhowca-
pacityisaffectedbya)thedifferencesbetweenunstructuredandlayeredairspaces;
b) conflict detection parameters; c) conflict resolution dimension; d) conflict reso-
lution priority; and e) the speed distribution of aircraft.
5.4.1. Simulation Development
5.4.1.1. Simulation Platform
TheBlueSkyopen-sourceATMsimulatorwasusedasthesimulationplatforminthis
research. It was developed at the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) using
the Python programming language3. BlueSky has numerous features including the
abilitytosimulatemorethan5000aircraftsimultaneously,asuiteofconflictdetec-
tion and resolution algorithms, and extensive data logging functions. A complete
overview of BlueSky is provided in [108].
In order to simulate aircraft performance dynamics, BlueSky uses point-mass Air-
craft Performance Models (APMs) that are similar in structure to Eurocontrol’s well
known Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) models. The main difference between these
two approaches is that BlueSky uses openly available data to quantify the APMs.
To simplify the simulations, all traffic was simulated using a Boeing 744 model.
A full description of the BlueSky APMs, including their validation, can be found
in [109].

5.4.1.2. Conflict Detection
As stated before, the state-based Conflict Detection (CD) method was used in this
study, see section 5.3.3.1. For most of the experiments performed in this study,
a look-ahead time of 5 minutes, as well as separation requirements of 5 nautical
mileshorizontallyand1000ftvertically,wereused. The‘ConflictDetection’experi-
ment,ontheotherhand,variedthevaluesofthesethreeparametersovermultiple
settings to study the effects of separation requirements and look-ahead time on
airspace capacity; see Table 5.5.
It should be noted that CD was performed assuming perfect knowledge of aircraft
states. ThisisinlinewiththefindingsofarecentstudythatconcludedthatADS-B
characteristics have little effect on the performance of the CD&R algorithms used
in this work [25].
5.4.1.3. Conflict Resolution and Trajectory Recovery
Once conflicts were detected, the Modified Voltage Potential (MVP) algorithm was
5
used for tactical Conflict Resolution (CR). MVP works similar to the repulsion that
occurs between similarly charged particles to resolve conflicts between aircraft in
a pairwise fashion. Furthermore, MVP uses minimum path deviations to reduce
theeffectofresolutionmaneuversonflightefficiency;theresolutionstrategyused
by MVP is illustrated in Figure 5.8 for the horizontal direction. A distinguishing
characteristic of MVP is that it uses vector summation to determine the final CR
avoidance maneuver for multi-aircraft conflicts. MVP has been used and validated
by a number of previous studies [20, 30, 73, 74]. For a full description of the MVP
algorithm, the reader is referred to [15, 20, 30].
For layered airspace designs, it is necessary to restrict conflict resolutions to the
horizontal direction (using combined heading and speed maneuvers). This is be-
cause vertical resolutions could cause new conflicts with aircraft in adjacent flight
levels, and thus negate the safety benefits offered by the predefined flight levels
used in this airspace concept; see Figure 5.3. Therefore, conflict resolutions are
limited to the horizontal direction for most experiments performed in this study, as
this allows for a fair comparison between unstructured and layered airspace de-
signs. However, because UA does not impose altitude constraints on traffic, the
effects of both horizontal and vertical resolution maneuvers on its maximum the-
oretical capacity are specifically investigated in the ‘Conflict Resolution Dimension’
experiment;seesections5.4.3.3and5.5.3. Regardless,theMVPalgorithmisused
for tactical CR in all cases. The resolution dimension used in each of the five ex-
periments are summarized in Table 5.6.
ItisalsoworthnotingthattheCRinstructionsissuedbyMVPtookprecedenceover
theroutingconstraintsimposedbyaparticularairspacedesign. Nonetheless,after
CR, aircraft flew directly to their pre-conflict sector exit waypoints in the horizontal
direction, for both unstructured and layered airspaces. However, in the vertical
direction, the trajectory recovery procedure differed between the two airspace de-
signs. In UA, aircraft were allowed to directly return to their pre-conflict altitudes.

--- Page 197 ---

178 5. Capacity Assessment Method for Decentralized ATC
In layered airspaces, aircraft had to first check if the direct heading to their target
waypoint conformed to the heading-altitude rules in force. If the direct path vio-
lated these rules, then aircraft were required to climb/descend to the closest flight
level that permitted their desired horizontal travel directions.
5.4.1.4. Airspace Concepts and Concept Implementation
Unstructured Airspace (UA) and four layered airspace concepts, each with a differ-
entallowedheadingrangeperflightlevel,𝛼,wereusedinthefast-timesimulations.
Table 5.1 displays the properties of the considered airspace concepts.

The airspace concepts were implemented into BlueSky by modifying its trajectory
planning functions. While direct horizontal routes were used in both unstructured
and layered airspaces, the method used to determine the cruising altitude of an
aircraft differed between the two airspace designs. For UA, the cruising altitude of
an aircraft, 𝑍 , was directly proportional to its trip distance, 𝐷:

Here, 𝛽 is the number of flight levels needed to define one complete set of layers,
and 𝜅 is the number of complete layer sets. These two parameters are defined as
5
𝛽 = 360(cid:4968)/𝛼 and 𝜅 = 𝐿/𝛽, where 𝐿 is the total number of available flight levels.
Note that the second term of equation 5.45 computes the cruising altitude of an
aircraftasanintegermultipleoftheverticalspacingbetweenflightlevels, 𝜁,using
the the floor operator (‘⌊ ⌋’). For all layered concepts in this study, 𝜁 =1100 ft and
𝐿 = 8. Correspondingly, for most layered concepts considered here, 𝜅 > 1; see
Table 5.1. For layered concepts with 𝜅 > 1, equation 5.45 uses trip distances to
determine cruising altitudes such that short flights remain at lower altitudes, while
longer flights use higher layer sets.
ItshouldbenotedthattheonlydifferencebetweentheUAandL360conceptsisthe
use of predefined flight levels for cruising aircraft in L360, while any altitude could
be selected by aircraft in UA. In fact, the L360 concept was specifically included in
the simulations to investigate the effect of using fixed cruising flight levels while
simultaneously allowing all possible headings in each flight level on the maximum
theoretical capacity of the airspace.
5.4.2. Traffic Scenarios
5.4.2.1. Testing Region and Flight Profiles
A large three-dimensional en-route sector was used as the physical environment
for traffic simulations, see Figure 5.9. In the horizontal plane, the sector had a
square-shapedcross-sectionof400x400nauticalmiles. Intheverticaldimension,
the sector is divided into two parts; a ‘transition zone’ with a height of 4000 ft
for climbing and descending traffic, and a ‘cruising zone’ with a height of 7700
ft. Figure 5.9 also shows the horizontal and vertical flight profiles of an example
flight.
As no traffic was simulated outside the simulated sector, aircraft near the edges of
the‘simulationregion’areunlikelytogetintoconflicts. Tosolvethisissue,asmaller

cylindrical ‘experiment region’, with a diameter of 300 nautical miles, was defined
in the center of the ‘simulation region’. The resulting gap between the experiment
and simulation regions ensured that aircraft within the experiment region were
surrounded by traffic in all directions. Correspondingly, only aircraft within the
experiment region, and only conflicts with closest points of approach within the
experiment region, were used to analyze results of the simulation and determine
airspacecapacity. Theparametersoftheexperimentregionneededtoevaluatethe
models, as well as other parameters common to all five experiments, are listed in

density were defined, ranging between 5-50 aircraft per 10,000 NM(cid:4796) in the sim-
ulation region. This corresponds to an instantaneous traffic demand of between
80-800 aircraft in the simulation region; see Table 5.3. Note that the maximum

Furthermore,tenrepetitions,representingtenrandomtrafficrealizations(i.e,initial

To ensure that all airspace concepts were subjected to the same traffic demand
and horizontal traffic patterns, all scenarios were generated off-line prior to the
simulations. Scenarios were created with a duration of 3 hours, consisting of a 1
hourtrafficvolumebuildupperiod,a1hourloggingperiod,anda1hourwind-down
period. Trafficdensitywasheldconstantattherequiredlevelduringtheloggingand
wind-down periods. The latter period was required to allow aircraft created during
the logging hour to finish their flights, and thus prevent abnormally short flights
from skewing the results. Moreover, all scenarios were repeated with and without
CR such that the DEP could be computed using logged total conflict count data for
the‘experimentregion’. Furthermore,toenableanalysisofallCAMDAsub-models,
the number of instantaneous aircraft, and the number of instantaneous conflicts,
within the ‘experiment region’, was logged periodically every 15 seconds.

5.4.3. Independent Variables
The independent variables of the five simulation experiments performed in study
are discussed below.
5.4.3.1. Airspace Concept Experiment
The first experiment aimed to compare unstructured and layered airspace designs
in terms of capacity. The independent variables of this experiment were:
• 5 airspace concepts; see Table 5.4
• 1 CD setting, namely ‘Baseline; see Table 5.5
• 2 CR settings, namely ‘CR OFF’ and ‘CR ON Horizontal’; see Table 5.6
• 1 priority setting, namely ’Cooperative’; see Table 5.7
• 1 speed distribution, namely ‘Equal’; see Table 5.8
5
• 10 traffic demand scenarios; see Table 5.3
Ten repetitions were performed for each traffic demand condition. Therefore, this
experiment resulted in a total of 1000 simulation runs, involving over 1.75 million
flights.

used to assess the accuracies of the CAMDA sub-models. The specific approach
used to measure accuracy varied between the analytical and semi-empirical com-
ponents of the CAMDA framework. The appropriate methods are discussed with
the corresponding results in the following section.

5.5. Results
This section presents the results of the five fast-time simulation experiments. As
indicated previously, the results are applicable for decentralized unstructured and
layered airspace designs that utilize the state-based CD method, and the MVP CR
algorithm.
5.5.1. Airspace Concept Experiment
Heading-altitude rules and predefined flight levels differentiate layered airspaces
fromUnstructuredAirspace(UA).Thegoalofthisexperiment,therefore,wastoex-

following paragraphs discuss the results of the analytical and the semi-empirical
components of the CAMDA framework separately.

186 5. Capacity Assessment Method for Decentralized ATC
To measure the accuracy of the analytical models, a model accuracy parameter, 𝑘,
is introduced:
Simulation Measurement=Analytical Model×𝑘
Here it can be seen that 𝑘 acts as a constant scaling parameter to the analytical
models. Its value is determined by fitting the models to the simulation data in a
least-square sense. A value of 𝑘 close to 1 indicates high model accuracy, while
𝑘 < 1 and 𝑘 > 1 indicates model over- and under-estimation of simulation data,
respectively. Model accuracy is also computed as a percentage by comparing the
fitted ‘𝑘 value’ to a reference value of 1. The 𝑘 values are indicated on the top-left
corner of the four graphs displayed in Figure 5.10.

The results for 𝐶 are displayed in Figure 5.10(a). The figure shows that the
(cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
analytical models for 𝐶 , given by equations 5.3 and 5.25 for unstructured

andlayeredairspaces,areabletopredictboththeshapeandthemagnitudeofthe
simulationdataforallairspaceconcepts. Thishighaccuracyisreflectedby𝑘values
that are very close to 1, particularly for UA and L360. Although accuracies for all
airspaceconceptsaregreaterthan85%,the𝑘valuesforlayeredairspacesindicates
that the corresponding model slightly over-estimates the number of conflicts, and
that the degree of overestimation increases as the heading range per flight level,
𝛼, is decreased.
Thereductionofmodelaccuracyforsmaller𝛼 canbeexplainedbyconsideringthe
simulation’s design, and the process of conflict detection for climbing/descending
aircraft. As indicated by Figure 5.5(b), in state-based CD, the volume of airspace
searched for conflicts by an aircraft can be decomposed into separate horizon-
tal and vertical components. For climbing/descending aircraft, theverticalconflict
searchvolumecanextendbeyondtheupperandlowerboundariesofthesimulated
sector. Since no traffic was simulated outside the considered sector, climbing/de-
scending aircraft are, therefore, less likely to detect conflicts, particularly near the
edgesofthesector. Althoughthissimulationartifactaffectsbothairspacedesigns,
previous research has shown that the significant increase in the proportion of con-
flicts involving climbing/descending aircraft in layered airspaces leads to a greater
over-estimationbythecorrespondingmodel,explainingtheaccuracyresultsnoted
above. Previous research has also validated this explanation by showing that a
decrease of the flight-path angles of climbing/descending aircraft increases model
accuracy,asthisreducesthesizeoftheverticalconflictsearchvolume[118].
Because Figure 5.10(a) considers the situation without CR, it can be used to com-
pare the five airspace concepts in terms of the ‘intrinsic safety’ that they provide.
Here, the notion of intrinsic safety focuses purely on the effect of the constraints
imposed by an airspace design on the number of instantaneous conflicts. Fig-
ure 5.10(a) shows that layered airspaces are intrinsically safer than UA, and that
the safety of layered airspaces increases as 𝛼 is decreased. In addition to the

--- Page 206 ---

5.5. Results 187
beneficial effect of reducing 𝛼 on intrinsic safety, comparison of the UA and L360
concepts indicates that the use of predefined flight-levels also decreases the num-
ber of instantaneous conflicts.
Step2: TotalConflictCountWithoutConflictResolution,C

Figure 5.10(b) shows the results for the second model of the CAMDA framework,
namely 𝐶 . As for 𝐶 , this figure shows that layered airspaces reduced
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4967)(cid:4971) (cid:4962)(cid:4967)(cid:4972)(cid:4973),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)

(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)

case), while taking into account the average duration of a conflict (which is in turn
dependentonthelook-aheadtime);seeequation5.8forUAandequation5.36for

Although the model curves in Figure 5.10(b) closely follow the trend between
𝐶 and traffic density, it can be seen that the corresponding models for both
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
airspace designs underestimate the total conflict count without CR. This underes-

such pop-up conflicts reduce the average conflict duration in the simulation, and
becauseoftheeffectsofpop-upconflictsarenottakenintoaccountbythemodels

The results for 𝐶(cid:5539) with and without CR are pictured in Figure 5.10(c). Note that
(cid:4795)
due to limited space, the figure only displays the results for the Layers 45 (L45)
concept; the results for the other airspace concepts are similar. Moreover, the L45
concept led to the lowest model accuracy of all considered concepts.

thermore, the difference between the model predictions and the simulation results
appears to increase beyond this density. It is hypothesized that the larger number
of conflict chain reactions that occur at higher densities leads to a break-down of
thisassumption;forinstance,ifsuchconflictchainsareconcentratedinoneormore
partsoftheairspace, thenitislogicalthat, onaverage,thelocalconflictcountper
unit distance with CR would increase relative to the case without CR.
Regardless, Figure 5.10(c) indicates that the first assumption made by the CAMDA
framework, that 𝐶(cid:5539) = 𝐶(cid:5539) , is only valid for densities that are comparable to
(cid:4795),(cid:4976)(cid:4971) (cid:4795),(cid:4967)(cid:4971)
todays peak densities (32 aircraft per 10,000 𝑁𝑀(cid:4796) over the Netherlands in 2017).
Fordensitiesthatareapproximatelythreetimesgreaterthantoday,thisassumption
does not hold in a purely mathematical sense. However, because the absolute
difference between model and simulation at the highest simulated density is less
than 2e-3 conflicts per aircraft per nautical mile, the violation of this assumption
is not likely to significantly affect the final CAMDA capacity estimate; at this level
of difference, an aircraft would have to fly an additional 500 NM, which is double
the average flight distance of aircraft in the simulation, for it to encounter just one
additional conflict relative to the model prediction for Layers 45. This conclusion is

corresponding results for L45 are displayed in Figure 5.10(d); the results for the
other airspace concepts are identical but are not shown in the interest of space.

thatthesecondassumptionusedbyCAMDAisvalidforallconsidereddensitiesand
airspace concepts.
It is interesting to note that Figures 5.10(c) and 5.10(d) show that CR increased
traffic densities even though the exact same traffic scenarios were used for sim-
ulations with and without CR. This is because CR maneuvers increase the flight
distances of aircraft, which in turn increases the average number of instantaneous
aircraft within the simulated sector at any given moment in time. The increase of
flightdistance(and/orflighttime)withCRiscentraltothederivationoftheCAMDA
capacity framework; see section 5.3.3.5.
5.5.1.2. Semi-Empirical Model Components
The last two models of the CAMDA framework, namely 𝐶 and the DEP, are
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4976)(cid:4971)
influenced by 𝐷 . This parameter describes the extra distance flown by an air-
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)(cid:4971)
craft to resolve each detected conflict and to return to its pre-conflict sector exit
waypoint; see Figure 5.6. Because 𝐷 is affected by conflict chain reactions,
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)(cid:4971) 5
its value can only be determined by fitting the model for 𝐶 , or equally the
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4976)(cid:4971)
model for the DEP, to the simulation data in a least-squares sense. As these two
modelsaresemi-empirical,itis,therefore,notpossibletomeasuremodelaccuracy
using the procedure outlined earlier for the analytical components of the CAMDA
framework.
Instead, the accuracy of the semi-empirical models can be determined by consid-
ering two aspects. The first aspect is qualitative, and it considers the ability of
the models to predict the shape of the relationship between traffic density and the
airspace state of interest, in this case 𝐶 and the DEP. This aspect can be
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4976)(cid:4971)
studied visually by checking whether the shape of the fitted model curve follows
thetrendsdisplayedbytherawsimulationdata. Ifthefittedmodelcurvematches
wellwiththesimulationdataforallexperimentconditions,thenthebasicstructure
of the model can be regarded to be sound.

isusedtodeterminethevalueofthesemi-empiricalparameter,𝐷 . Subsequently,
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)(cid:4971)
the Root Mean Square (RMS) error between model predictions and the empirical
dataiscomputedforbothtrainingandvalidationdatasets. IftheRMSerrorforthe
training dataset is small, then the fitting accuracy is considered to be high. If the
RMSerrorsforbothtrainingandvalidationdatasetsarecomparable,thenthemodel
fitting process was not significantly affected by simulation artifacts and noise, i.e,
over-fitting was limited.

Figure 5.11(a) shows the results for 𝐶 , i.e., the with CR counterpart of Fig-

CR was the highest for UA. However, on comparing Figures 5.10(b) and 5.11(a),

it can be seen that CR appears to have reduced the relative differences between
the concepts, particularly between the layered concepts; compare, for instance,
the difference between the L90 and L45 concepts in Figures 5.10(b) and 5.11(a).
Nonetheless, as the fitted model curves closely approximate the shape and the
magnitudeofthesimulationdata,itcanbeconcludedthatthecorrespondingmod-
els, given by equations 5.19 and 5.39 for unstructured and layered concepts, well
represent the trends between 𝐶 and traffic density.
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965),(cid:4976)(cid:4971)
To quantify the accuracy of the model fits for 𝐶 , Figure 5.11(b) displays the

training dataset of UA corresponds to an error of only 6% relative to the average
number of conflicts logged for this airspace design (across all traffic densities and
repetitions). On a similar note, the errors for the training and validation datasets
are comparable for each airspace concept. For these two reasons, the accuracy of
the model fits can be considered to be high.

5.5. Results 191
Step6: DominoEffectParameter(DEP)andAirspaceCapacity
The results for the DEP are pictured in Figure 5.11(c). As expected, the figure
shows that the DEP, which considers the occurrence and propagation of conflict
chain reactions, increases nonlinearly with traffic density for all airspace concepts.
However, the empirical DEP values, i.e., scatter points in Figure 5.11(c), appear to
be very noisy at low densities. This can be attributed to the fact that the empirical
DEP values are obtained bydividingsimulation logged conflict counts for scenario
repetitions with and without CR, and the output of this division process is particu-
larly sensitive to the relatively few conflicts that occur at low traffic densities; see
equation 5.1. Nevertheless, Figure 5.11(c) indicates that the fitted model curves
for all airspace concepts closely approximate the shape and magnitude of the em-
pirical DEP data at high traffic densities. The accuracy of the model fitting process
is further highlighted by the low RMS errors found for both training and validation
datasets, given the ‘noisy’ empirical data; see Figure 5.11(d).

the CPA, such that minimum separation requirements are just met. As constant
aircraft velocities are assumed within the look-ahead time, the magnitude of the
‘push’ that is necessary to resolve conflicts in this manner is inversely proportional
to 𝐷 . However, because smaller values of 𝛼 reduce conflict angles between
(cid:4956)(cid:4969)(cid:4954)

tothenumberofconflictswithandwithoutCR,reducing𝛼doesnotincreaseofthe
capacityof layered airspaces that use MVP because the safety benefits of lowering
𝛼 are counteracted by the efficiency drop caused by longer CR trajectories.
5.5.2. Conflict Detection Experiment
The goal of the Conflict Detection (CD) experiment is to study the effects of hori-
zontalandverticalseparationrequirements,andlook-aheadtime,onthemaximum
theoreticalcapacitiesoftheUAandL45airspaceconcepts. Figure5.12displaysthe
corresponding DEP and capacity results for this experiment. Here it can be seen
thatseparationrequirementshaveasignificantlylargereffectoncapacitythanlook-
aheadtimeforbothairspaceconcepts. Asfortheairspaceconceptexperiment,this
trend can be understood by considering the effects of CD parameters on conflict
probability,𝑝,andtheextradistanceflownbyaircraftduetoeachconflictresolution
maneuver, 𝐷 .
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)(cid:4971)
The effect of CD parameters on 𝑝 can be studied using equation 5.4. This equa-
tion states that a halving of the look-ahead time leads to a halving of 𝑝, while a
having of horizontal and vertical separation requirements leads to a quartering of
𝑝. This indicates that separation requirements have a much larger effect of on 𝑝,
and therefore, on 𝜌 , than look-ahead time.

(cid:4956)(cid:4957)(cid:4971)

airspace designs, Figure 5.12 indicates that 𝐷 minimizes the capacity benefits
(cid:4930)(cid:4931)(cid:4945)
of reducing CD parameters. This is particularly the case when look-ahead time is
halved for L45; instead of doubling capacity relative to the baseline condition, a

halving of look-ahead time increases 𝐷 such that capacity is only increased by 5
(cid:4956)(cid:4957)(cid:4971)
approximately 18%. This indicates that 𝐷 actually increases as the look-ahead
(cid:4930)(cid:4931)(cid:4945)
time is reduced, and this increase in 𝐷 reduces the beneficial capacity effect of
(cid:4930)(cid:4931)(cid:4945)
reducingthe look-aheadtime on conflict probability. Moreover, an inverserelation-
ship between 𝐷 and look-aheadtime is logical since a largerheading deviation,
(cid:4930)(cid:4931)(cid:4945)
and therefore a larger path deviation, is needed when conflicts are detected and
resolved later in time.
5.5.3. Conflict Resolution Experiment
The third experiment investigated the effect of conflict resolution dimension on
airspace capacity. To this end, simulations for UA were repeated for the cases
whereconflictresolutionwasa)limitedtothehorizontaldirectionandb)limitedto
the vertical direction. The DEP and capacity results for this experiment are shown
inFigure5.13. Hereitcanbeseenthattheairspacebecomesmoreunstablewhen
vertical conflict resolutions are used. In fact, limiting CR to the vertical direction
decreases airspace capacity by more than a third.
Although the horizontal separation requirement is 30 times larger than the verti-
cal separation minima for the settings used in this experiment, see Table 5.5, this
unusual result can be explained by considering the horizontal and vertical den-
sity distributions of aircraft. In en route airspace, aircraft tend to be more closely
packed in the vertical direction than in the horizontal plane. For example, most
long-distance flights cruise between FL300-FL400, whereas aircraft can be sepa-
rated in the horizontal direction by many nautical miles. As a result of the closer
packingofaircraftalongtheverticaldirection,verticalconflictresolutionmaneuvers
are more likely to trigger new conflicts, and therefore, more like to cause conflict
chainreactions. Consequently,verticalresolutionsreducethemaximumtheoretical
capacity of the airspace.

5.5.4. Priority Experiment
While all other experiments used cooperative conflict resolutions, this experiment
5
consideredtheimpactofconflictresolutionpriorityonairspacecapacity. Therefore,
in addition to cooperative resolutions, simulations were performed for the cases
where priority was assigned to either climbing/descending aircraft or to cruising
aircraft; see Table 5.7. The corresponding DEP and airspace capacity results for
the UA and L45 concepts are displayed in Figure 5.14. This figure shows that pri-
ority had different effects on the two airspace concepts. For UA, capacity was the
highest when cruising aircraft had priority, but for L45, the situation was reversed,
and capacity was maximized when climbing/descending aircraft were given prior-
ity.

The opposite trends displayed by the UA and L45 concepts can be understood by
considering two factors: a) the process of CD and b) the proportion of aircraft in
different flight phases. In UA, all aircraft, regardless of flight phase, search for
conflictswithinavolumeofairspaceinfrontofthem,seeFigure5.5. Althoughthis

--- Page 214 ---

5.5. Results 195
volume is slightly larger for climbing and descending aircraft, conflict probabilities
for all flight phases are comparable in magnitude as aircraft horizontal speeds are
much higher than their vertical speeds in en route airspaces. Instead, capacity is
maximizedinUAwhenpriorityisgiventocruisingaircraftbecausethevastmajority
ofaircraftareinthecruisephase(82%inthesimulationsconsideredhere). There-
fore, by shifting the burden of conflict resolutions to the minority of aircraft, i.e.,
climbing/descendingaircraft,capacityisincreasedbyapproximately10%(compare
green and blue lines in Figure 5.14(a)).
However, in layered airspaces, conflict probability is significantly dependent on the
flight phases of interacting aircraft. This is because conflict probability is a func-
tion of theareaof airspace searched for conflicts for cruising aircraft, whereas for
climbing/descendingaircraft,itisdependentonthevolumeofairspacesearchedfor
conflicts. Asaresultofthesmallerregionofairspacesearchedforconflicts,conflict

reason, even though there are vastly more cruising aircraft in the airspace, resolu-

in maximum capacity when climbing/descending aircraft are assigned priority over
cruising traffic in layered airspaces (relative to all other priority settings).
5.5.5. Ground Speed Experiment
To reduce the complexity of the derivation process, the models described in this
chapter assume equal grounds speeds for all aircraft. This assumption ignores
possibility of overtaking conflicts, and it primarily affects the computation of the
expected horizontal relative velocities between aircraft, E(𝑉 ); see equations 5.4
(cid:4971),(cid:4961)
and 5.27. To study the effect of this assumption on airspace capacity, simulations
for the UA and L45 airspace concepts were performed for the conditions where
aircraft speeds were a) equal, b) normally distributed and c) uniformly distributed;
see Table 5.8.

5.6. Discussion
This chapter presented the derivation of the Capacity Assessment Method for De-
centralized Air Traffic Control (CAMDA). CAMDA is a semi-empirical method, and
it was demonstrated here using fast-time simulations of unstructured and layered
airspace designs that utilized the state-based Conflict Detection (CD) method, and
the Modified Voltage Potential (MVP) Conflict Resolution (CR) algorithm. This sec-
tion reflects on the results of the simulations and discusses the accuracy of the
underlying models of the CAMDA framework. Additionally, important aspects re-
lated to the usage of the CAMDA method are also considered.
5.6.1. Unstructured vs. Layered Airspace Designs
Analogous to the safety trends reported by previous studies, analysis of the cur-
rentexperimentalresultsusingtheCAMDAapproachindicatedthatthecapacityof
layered airspace designs is higher that of the unstructured airspace concept. The

--- Page 216 ---

5.6. Discussion 197
increased safety and capacity of layered concepts can be attributed to the two as-
pects that differentiate unstructured and layered airspaces: the use of predefined
flight levels, and the use of heading-altitude rules. Because these two design ele-
ments reduce the average conflict probability and the number of possible conflict
pairs,boththenumberofconflictsandthenumberofconflictchainreactionswere
found to be lower for layered airspaces. As the CAMDA framework defines capac-
ity to be inversely related to the number of conflict chain reactions, capacity was
determined to higher for layered airspaces.
However, a direct correlation between safety and capacity was notfound for the
different layered airspace concepts considered here, which differed in terms of the
heading range allowed per flight level. Although decreasing the heading range
lowered the total number of conflicts, reductions of this parameter did not lead to
a consistent improvement of the number of conflict chain reactions. In fact, the
CAMDA computed capacity estimate actually decreased slightly when the heading
range per flight level was decreased below 180(cid:4968).

of the MVP CR algorithm when it is used in combination with layered airspace de-
signs. TheMVPalgorithmactsby‘pushing’conflictingaircraftpairsawayfromeach

just satisfied. For unstructured airspaces, this approach does not negatively affect
CR performance. But for layered airspaces, a reduction of the heading range per
flightlevelincreasesthedistancesbetweenconflictingaircraftpairsandtheirCPAs.
This in turn increases the length of CR trajectories as the heading range per flight
level is reduced for layered airspaces. Therefore, the capacity of layered airspaces
that use MVP for CR does not increase as the heading range per flight level is de-
creasedbecausethecorrespondingsafetybenefitsarenegated,andinsomecases,
outweighed,bytheincreasinginefficiencywithwhichconflictsareresolved.
Fromtheaboveanalysis,itcanbeconcludedthatthemaximumairspacecapacityis
stronglydependentonboththesafetyandefficiencyoftravel,andthatboththese
performance measures are affected by the selected airspace design, and the se-
lected algorithms for Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R). Here, the airspace
design affects the safety and efficiency of the plannedflight routes, whereas the
algorithms for CD&R contributes to the safety and efficiency of the actuallyflown
trajectories. As such, an optimization of airspace capacity requires an optimization
of both airspace design and CD&R algorithm. If this is not the case, the beneficial
characteristicsofanairspacedesign,canforinstance,bebottleneckedbythecho-
sen CD&R method, as was the case for the pairing between layered airspaces and
the MVP algorithm in this study.
5.6.2. Unexpected Results
In addition to the trends described above, analysis of the simulation results led to
two particularly unexpected conclusions. These were related to the effects of CR
priority and CR dimension on maximum airspace capacity.

--- Page 217 ---

198 5. Capacity Assessment Method for Decentralized ATC
Conventional ATM wisdom suggests that CR priority, when dependent on the flight
phases of aircraft, should be assigned to the flight phase exhibited by the majority
of aircraft. As most aircraft in en route airspaces are in the cruise phase of flight,
thisreasoningsuggeststhatassigningprioritytocruisingtrafficwouldmaximizeen
route airspace capacity. While this was indeed the case for unstructured airspace,
for layered airspaces, capacity was higher when climbing/descending aircraft were
given priority. This counterintuitive result can be explained by the fact that the
predefinedflightlevelsusedbylayeredairspacesleadstosignificantlylowerconflict
probabilities for cruising traffic than for climbing/descending aircraft. As such, any
maneuveringbycruisingtrafficislesslikelytotriggeradditional‘secondary’conflicts
during the resolution of a ‘primary’ conflict. For this reason, even though 82% of
aircraftinthesimulationswerecruisingatanygivenmomentintime,capacitywas
increased by around 20% when the burden of CR was shifted to cruising traffic in
layered airspaces.
Because vertical separation requirements are often an order of magnitude smaller
thantheirhorizontalcounterparts,verticalCRisexpectedtobemoreefficient,and
5
therefore, lead to higher capacities relative to resolutions that are limited to the
horizontal direction. This logic is indeed true when considering an isolated conflict
between twoaircraft. However, for a populationof aircraft, it is also necessary
to consider the horizontal and vertical distributions of aircraft locations when ex-
amining the influence of CR dimension on capacity. Because aircraft in en route
airspaces tend to be packed more closely together in the vertical direction than in
the horizontal plane, vertical CR is more likely to trigger conflict chains. As a re-
sult, the simulations performed here indicated a threefold increase in the number
of conflict chain reactions, as well as a corresponding decrease of capacity, when
conflicts were resolved using vertical speed changes alone. If skewed separation
standardsarealsoproposedforfutureunmannedaircraftoperationsinlowaltitude
urban airspaces, this conclusion suggests that maximum capacity would benefit
significantly from the use horizontal conflict resolutions for such scenarios.
As implied above, the initially surprising results can be explained using the under-
lyingmodelsoftheCAMDAframework, aswellasbyusingtheassociatedcapacity
definition that measures capacity from the perspective of conflict chain reactions.
Assuch,thetwocasesdescribedaboveillustratetheutilityoftheCAMDAmethod;
becausethealltheparametersoftheunderlyingmodelsarederivedwithaphysical
interpretation, the effect of a number of factors on capacity can be directly under-
stood from the structure of the models themselves. This in turn allows for a more
systematicselectionoftherequiredexperimentalconditions,andthusspeedingup
the analysis of a new decentralized airspace concept.
5.6.3. Accuracy of CAMDA Models
The CAMDA framework is composed of six sequential steps, consisting of four an-
alytical and two empirical models. The accuracies of the analytical models were
computedbycomparingsimulationresultstomodelpredictions. Thisapproachre-

--- Page 218 ---

5.6. Discussion 199
vealed high accuracies for the first three analytical models. However, the accuracy
of the fourth analytical model, which calculates the conflict rate per aircraft with
CR, varied with traffic density; accuracy was high for densities up to today’s peak
demand,butitdegradedforhigherdensities. Nevertheless,asoverallaccuracyfor
allconsidereddensitieswasfoundtobeapproximately80%forthisparameter,this
error did not significantly affect the accuracy of the final empirical components of
the CAMDA framework. This is because minor errors from the preceding analyti-
cal steps are absorbed into the value estimated for the one empirical parameter of
the framework, which considers the extra distance flown per CR maneuver. Fur-
thermore,qualitativeandquantitativemethodsindicatedthattheempiricalmodels
were capable of accurately describing the relationship between traffic density and
the number of conflict chain reactions in the airspace, for all tested conditions and
airspaceconcepts. Therefore,thefinalCAMDAcomputedcapacityestimatecanbe
considered to be sufficiently accurate for performing tradeoffs between different
airspace designs and/or CD&R algorithms.

5.6.4. Additional Considerations
Asmentionedpreviously,CAMDAisasemi-empiricalmethod. Itisreliantonempir-
icaldata,obtainedthroughsimulation,toassessthecapacityofanairspacedesign
and CD&R algorithm combination. Although simulations can be time consuming,
this reliance on empirical data increases versatility of the method; by applying ap-
propriate changes to the first step of the method, the CAMDA framework can be
adapted to assess the capacities of airspace designs and CD&R algorithms other
than those considered in this study. In fact, this approach was used here to de-
rive the required models for layered airspaces using the models initially developed
for the unstructured airspace concept. This versatility also allows it to be used to
investigate the effects of a number of operational conditions that were not tested
here, such as the effects of hardware failures and/or various weather phenomena
oncapacity,aslongasadequatelyrealisticsimulationmodelscanbedevelopedfor
the required use cases.
Itisimportanttorealizethatthereisacleardistinctionbetweenthetheoreticaland
the operationally relevant practical capacity of the airspace. The CAMDA method
developed in this work focuses on the theoretical capacity limit. The theoretical
capacitylimitcanbeusedasametrictocomparedifferentairspacedesignoptions.
Furthermore, the CAMDA approach makes it possible to understand how the fea-
turesofaparticularairspacedesigncontributetoitstheoreticalcapacity. However
this theoretical capacity limit is hypothetical, as it represents a situation where air-
craft never reach their destination, but are in a persistent state of conflict. This
theoretical capacity limit on its own therefore has no operational relevance.
For an operational capacity limit, it is necessary to define thresholds on safety and
efficiency. Here, thresholds on safety, e.g., target levels of safety (e.g. 10(cid:4805)7
incidents per hour), are dependent on what we as a society find an acceptable
risk of an incident occurring. Efficiency limits are dictated by economic demands

2. Fast-timesimulationresultsshowedthattheunderlyingCAMDAmodelscan

Therefore, CAMDA can be used to perform tradeoffs between decentralized

3. Theverticalstructuringusedbylayeredairspacesprovideshighercapacities
thanforunstructuredairspace. But, decreasing the heading range per flight
level of layered airspaces did not significantly improve capacity as it does
safety. This is because the conflict resolution algorithm used here increased
flight distances as the heading range per flight level was decreased. This
indicates that safety and capacity should not be considered to be equivalent;
capacity is also affected by the efficiency with which conflicts are resolved.

Discussion
The current centralized system of Air Traffic Control (ATC) is widely reported to
be operating near its capacity limits. In response to this pressing issue, many
studies have proposed a decentralization of traffic separation responsibilities, from
ground-basedAirTrafficControllers(ATCos)toeachindividualaircraft,asameans
to increase airspace safety and capacity over today’s operations. To facilitate de-
centralized control, the research community has mainly focused its attention on
thedevelopmentofairborneConflictDetectionandResolution(CD&R)automation.
However, the further development and the implementation of this novel approach
to ATC has been hindered by three technical1 open problems related to decen-
tralizedairspacedesign,airspacesafetymodeling,andairspacecapacitymodeling.

and thereby increase airspace capacity [30, 37–39], while other studies have ar-

6.1. Discussion 205
The results of these simulations were unexpected; since previous studies had fo-
cusedononlyairspacedesignsthatcloselyresembledeitherFullMixorTubes,one
of these two extreme options for structuring traffic was expected to lead to the
highest capacity. The results, however, clearly indicated that a vertical segmenta-
tion of traffic, as used by Layers, led to the best balance of all considered metrics.
This approach not only lowered relative velocities between aircraft, it also permit-
ted direct horizontal routes. As such, the Layers concept led to the highest safety
of all concepts, without unduly reducing route efficiency relative to the completely
unstructuredFullMixdesign. Incontrast,astricthorizontalstructuringoftraffic,as
for Zones and Tubes, caused a mismatch between the imposed structure and the
traffic demand pattern. This in turn caused artificial traffic density hot-spots, and
reduced overall performance.
Of the different airspace designs considered, the highly structured Tubes concept
ledtothelowestcapacity. Thisconclusionwasemphasizedbytheresultsofsimula-
tionrunsthatusedrogueaircraft. Suchaircraft,whichdeliberatelyignoredconcept
dependent routing requirements, caused a break-down of the pre-planned routes
used by Tubes to separate traffic, and resulted in a large number of unintended
conflicts and intrusions. While all concepts were negatively influenced by the un-
certaintiescausedbyrogueaircraftandwind,theseresultsindicatedthatthesafety

Because of the empirical nature of the results, the conclusions drawn above are,
to some degree, sensitive to the specific parameter settings selected for the four
airspace concepts. However, given the magnitude of the differences in all of the
results, as well as the consistency between results, it is unlikely that the overall
trends are affected by different settings; capacity for decentralization was found
to improve when structural constraints fostered a reduction of relative velocities
betweenaircraft,andwhendirecthorizontalrouteswerepermitted. Thisconclusion
ismostapplicablefortrafficscenarioswithoutdistincthorizontalpatterns. Fortraffic
demand cases with discernible horizontal patterns, airspace concepts that permit
flexible routing in the horizontal direction are also expected to perform well, since
such structuring would not interfere with any demand pattern.
6.1.2. Safety Modeling
Given the supreme importance attached to the safety of air travel, it is unsurpris-
ing that many previous studies have developed analytical conflict count models to
quantifytheintrinsicsafetyprovidedbyanairspacedesign[66–69,101–103,106].
Such models are often referred to as ‘gas models’ in literature. This approach is
inspired by the collisions that occur between ideal gas particles, and it determines
instantaneoussystem-wideconflictcountsbetweenaircraftasameasureofintrinsic
airspace safety. However, most gas models developed previously have only con-
sidered conflicts involving cruising aircraft, and have relied on several assumptions

and layered airspace designs as case studies.
6.1.2.1. 3-D Analytical Conflict Count Models
Chapter3extended gas models for unstructured and layered airspace designs by
takingintoaccounttheeffectsofbothcruisingandclimbing/descendingaircrafton
conflict counts. The developed method groups aircraft according to flight phase,
while also considering the interactions, as well as the proportion of aircraft, in dif-
ferentflightphases. Thisapproachwascombinedwithasimplemethodtocompute
both the horizontal and vertical components of the expected relative velocity in an
airspace. The resulting analytical models could be used to compute the total 3-D
conflictprobabilitybetweenaircraftasafunctionoftrafficdemand,theconstraints
imposed by a particular airspace design, and airspace parameters, such as traffic
separation requirements and airspace area/volume.
Fast-timesimulationexperimentsthatwereusedtovalidatethemodelingapproach
indicated high accuracies for both airspace designs. Furthermore, the models sug-
gested,andthesimulationresultsconfirmed,thattheimprovedsafetyperformance
of layered airspaces could be attributed to the two aspects that differentiated un-
6 structured and layered designs: the use of predefined flight levels, and the use
of heading-altitude rules. The models indicated that these two design elements of
layered airspaces increased safety by reducing the number of combinations of two
cruising aircraft and the average conflict probability between aircraft.
Although layered designs improved the overall safety of en route airspaces, the
simulations also showed that there were no differences between unstructured and
layeredconceptsintermsofthenumberofconflictsinvolvingclimbing/descending
aircraft. In fact, the results clearly indicated that as the heading range per flight
levelisdecreased,theproportionofconflictsinvolvingclimbing/descendingaircraft
is increased. This indicates that such conflicts become more influential than con-
flicts between cruising aircraft for layered airspaces with a narrow heading range
perfightlevel. Thisresultemphasizestheimportanceoftakingintoaccountallrel-
evantaircraftflightphaseswhenassessingtheoverallintrinsicsafetyofanairspace
design. The 3-D models derived in chapter 3 were able to accurately capture this
important effect.
6.1.2.2. Effect of Traffic Scenario Assumptions
Mostanalyticalgasmodelsdescribedinliterature,includingthe3-Dmodelsderived
inchapter3,assume‘ideal’trafficscenarioproperties,namelyequalgroundspeeds
forallaircraft,aswellasuniformaircraftheading,altitudeandspatialdistributions.
In practice, however, a traffic scenario with this exact combination of properties
is unlikely to occur. This calls into question the accuracy of such models for more
realistic traffic scenarios.

--- Page 226 ---

6.1. Discussion 207
Chapter4investigated the accuracy of analytical gas models for ‘non-ideal’ traffic
scenarios. To this end, model predictions for unstructured and layered airspace
designs were compared with the results of four fast-time simulation experiments
withvaryingspeed,heading,altitudeandspatialdistributions. Ineachexperiment,
one of the four traffic scenario assumptions was intentionally violated in order to
determine the specific effect of each assumption on model accuracy.
Thisexerciserevealedthatnon-idealaltitudeandspatialdistributionshadthegreat-
estimpactonmodelaccuracy,withsomedistributionshapesresultinginaccuracies
as low as 50%. This is because non-uniform altitude and spatial distributions re-
sultedintrafficconcentrations,eitherverticallyorhorizontally,whichinturncaused
ahighernumberofconflictsrelativetotheidealcase. Theheadingdistributionalso
affected model accuracy, but the magnitude of its effect strongly depended on the
shape of the distributed used. Moreover, in contrast to the altitude and spatial
cases, non-ideal heading distributions led to a reduction of conflict counts. How-
ever, speed distribution only had a minor effect on accuracy. Speed distribution
is expected to have a greater impact on airspace concepts for which overtaking
conflicts are more common, such as layered airspaces with a very narrow heading
range per flight level (narrower than those considered here). Nonetheless, these
results strongly suggest that the predictions of analytical gas models should be
considered with caution for non-ideal traffic scenarios.
6
To further generalize the models, chapter 4 also presented so called ‘adjusted gas
models’whichusedanumericalapproachtorelaxthedependencyofthemodelson
theidealizedscenarioassumptions. Incontrasttothepurelyanalyticalmodels,the
numerically adjusted models were found to be very accurate for all tested condi-
tions. Because the adjustments only affect the computation of certain model com-
ponents, the basic structure of the adjusted models remain unchanged relative to
thebaselineanalyticalmodel. Therefore,inadditiontoprovidingaphysicalunder-
standing of the relationships between the parameters that affect intrinsic airspace
safety,theadjustedmodelscanalsobeusedtocomputethehighlyaccurateconflict
count estimates necessary for practical airspace design applications.
6.1.3. Capacity Modeling
Because conventional capacity measurement methods relate to aspects that are
not relevant for decentralized ATC, such as ATCo workload, most previous studies
in this domain have used qualitativemethods to determine the capacity limit of
decentralized concepts. Such qualitative methods measure capacity indirectlyby
analyzing the variation of safety and efficiency metrics, as well as other relevant
metrics, with traffic density. However this approach can result in biased capacity
estimates because weighting factors are necessary to rank the relative importance
of the considered metrics.

and propagation of conflict chain reactions. In addition to traffic demand, conflict
chain reactions are dependent on the routing constraints imposed by the selected
airspacedesign, andontheconflictresolutionactionscommandedbytheselected
CD&R algorithm. Because chain reactions elongate aircraft trajectories, they are
detrimentaltoboththesafetyandefficiencyperformanceoftheairspace. Assuch,
capacitymeasurementfromtheperspectiveofairspacestabilityimplicitlytakesinto
account the combined effects of airspace design and airborne CD&R on airspace
safety and efficiency, without the need for arbitrary weights.
Usingthenotionofairspacestability,chapter5developedtheCapacityAssessment
Method for Decentralized ATC (CAMDA). This method consisted of six steps, and
defined the capacity limit of decentralized airspace as the traffic density at which
the Domino Effect Parameter (DEP), a measure of the number of conflict chain
reactions, approaches infinity. A semi-empirical approach is used to identify the
capacity limit by combining analytical models that described the intrinsic safety
provided by an airspace design, i.e., using the output of chapter 3, with empirical
models that described the actions of decentralized CD&R algorithms.
Chapter 5 demonstrated the CAMDA method using fast-time simulations of de-
centralized unstructured and layered airspace designs that used the state-based
Conflict Detection (CD) method, and the Modified Voltage Potential (MVP) Conflict
6
Resolution (CR) algorithm. As expected, layered airspaces led to higher capacities
than the unstructured airspace design, reiterating the conclusion of chapter 2, as
well as the safetytrends noted in chapters 3 and 4. However, the capacities of the
differentlayereddesignstested,whichvariedintermsoftheheadingrangeallowed
perflightlevel,didnotfollowthetrendsinsafety. Althoughdecreasingtheheading
rangeperflightlevelloweredthenumberofconflicts,areductionofthisparameter
did not always improve capacity. Detailed analysis traced this unexpected result
to the behavior of the MVP CR algorithm when it is used in conjunction with lay-
ered airspaces. This is because the distance between conflicting aircraft and their
closestpointofapproach,andcorrespondingly,thelengthoftheMVPcommanded
resolution path, increases as the heading range of layered airspaces is decreased.
To summarize, the capacity of layered airspaces that use MVP for CR can be neg-
atively affected by the increasing inefficiencywith which conflicts are resolved as
the heading range per flight level is decreased.
Thesimulationsdescribedinchapter5alsostudiedhowcapacitywasaffectedbya

all cases, the CAMDA method estimated the occurrence of conflict chain reactions
withhighaccuracy,enablingcapacityestimationsusingrelativelynon-intensivelow

framework have a physical interpretation, the capacity effects of all tested con-
ditions could be directly understood from the structure of the underlying CAMDA
models. This in turn allows for a more systematic selection of the required experi-
mentalconditionswhenassessingthecapacitylimitofanewdecentralizedairspace

6.1.4. Additional Considerations
Theoreticalvs. PracticalCapacity
Itisimportanttorealizethatthereisacleardistinctionbetweenthetheoreticaland
the operationally relevant practical capacity of the airspace. The CAMDA method
developed in this work focuses on the theoretical capacity limit. The theoretical
capacitylimitcanbeusedasametrictocomparedifferentairspacedesignoptions.
Furthermore, the CAMDA approach makes it possible to understand how the fea-
turesofaparticularairspacedesigncontributetoitstheoreticalcapacity. However
this theoretical capacity limit is hypothetical, as it represents a situation where air-
craft never reach their destination, but are in a persistent state of conflict. This
theoretical capacity limit on its own therefore has no operational relevance.
For an operational capacity limit, it is necessary to define thresholds on safety and
efficiency. Here, thresholds on safety, e.g., target levels of safety (e.g. 10(cid:4805)7
incidents per hour), are dependent on what we as a society find an acceptable
risk of an incident occurring. Efficiency limits are dictated by economic demands
of the airspace users. Such targets are independent of the airspace design se-
lected. Nevertheless, using such desired targets, it is possible to use the CAMDA

ExtensiontoOtherAirspaceDesigns
Although the safety and capacity models derived in this thesis have focused on
unstructured and layered airspace designs, the underlying modeling methods can
be extended to other airspace concepts. Any adaptations along these lines would
require an analysis of how the constraints imposed by a particular airspace design
affect the number of combinations of two aircraft, and the conflict probability be-
tween any two aircraft2, since these two basic factors constitute the starting point
forboththesafetyandcapacitymodelsdiscussedhere. Infact,thisapproachwas
usedtoderivethemodelsforlayeredairspacesusingthemodelsinitiallydeveloped

to each sub-element, while also considering all possibleinteractionsbetween the
different sub-elements. These steps mirror the approach used to generalize the
safety models to take into account the effects of non-uniform spatial distributions
of traffic; see section 4.4.4.

6.2. Recommendations for Future Work
This section describes opportunities for future research in the domain of decen-
tralized ATC. Additionally, the expected societal impact of this work is briefly dis-
cussed.
6.2.1. Influence of Weather on Safety and Capacity
It is a well-known fact that bad weather can negatively affect airspace capacity
by reducing the safety and efficiency of operations. In Europe for example, bad
weather was one of the top three contributors to en route delays in 2016, costing
airlines over 150 million Euros in lost revenue. The effect of weather on traffic
flows is a complex topic, and it is the subject of many ongoing studies. Simply
put,fromtheperspectiveofairspacedesign,badweathercellscanblockaccessto
large areas of airspace, and it can therefore cause traffic re-routings, decreasing
the efficiency of travel. Additionally, bad weather, and strong winds in particular,
can severely reduce aircraft maneuverability, and this can in turn decrease options
for conflict resolution, affecting the safety of travel.
Although the empirical study described in chapter 2 of this thesis presented a pre-
6 liminary analysis of the effects of stochastic conditions, such as weather, on the
capacityofdecentralizedATC,thequantitativemodelsderivedinsubsequentchap-
tersdidnotconsidersucheffects. Infact,thesimulationsusedtovalidateallmodels
developedinthisthesisonlyconsideredidealweatherconditions. Nonetheless,itis
worthnotingthatthesemi-empiricalCAMDAcapacityassessmentmethoddescribed
in chapter 5 could, in theory, be used to quantify the capacity reductions caused
byvariousweatherphenomena,aslongassuchphenomenacanbesimulatedwith
adequaterealism. Thisisbecauseconflictchainreactions,whicharecentraltothe
CAMDA capacity definition, will invariably be affected by the type and the intensity
of the weather conditions considered. Consequently, an analysis along these lines
would be extremely valuable when evaluating the operational constraints affecting
decentralized control.
6.2.2. Dynamic Airspace Reconfiguration
This thesis has limited its attention to airspace designs that remain static in time.
But to maximize the efficiency with which the available airspace is utilized, it may
be beneficial to dynamically reconfigure the constraints imposed by a particular
airspace design to better match the demand pattern shifts that occur during the
course of a day. This concept can be illustrated for the Layers airspace design; all
layered designs considered here have assigned an equal number of flight levels to
each heading interval. This strategy of assigning flight levels results in a uniform
distributionofaircraftaltitudesonlyfortrafficscenarioswhichalsoexhibitauniform
distribution of aircraft headings. For other heading distributions, the vertical distri-
bution of traffic will be uneven, and this has been shown to decrease the intrinsic

6.2. Recommendations for Future Work 211
safety provided by layered designs; see Figure 4.16. But, by carefully reconfigur-
ing the airspace structure by assigning a greater number of flight levels to popular
travel directions, it may still be possible to realize a uniform distribution of aircraft
altitudes for scenarios with non-uniform heading distributions.
Althoughsuchdynamicreconfigurationscanbeadvantageousintermsofcapacity,
it is unclear how the safety of operations can be guaranteed during configuration
changes, and when and what configurations should be selected. This is an inter-
esting avenue for future research that deserves further analysis.
6.2.3. Tailored Conflict Resolution Algorithms for
Layered Airspaces
The results presented in chapter 5 indicated that the capacity of layered airspaces
wasbottleneckedbytheCRalgorithmusedinthisworkbecauseitunnecessarilyin-
creasedthelengthofconflictresolutiontrajectoriesforshallowangleconflicts. The
resulting decrease in efficiency outweighed the safety benefits offered by layered
airspaces when the heading range per flight level is decreased. It is hypothesized
that the capacity limits of layered airspaces can be further increased over the lev-
els found in this thesis by developing a conflict resolution algorithm that prioritizes
the efficiency of conflict resolution paths. This may be achieved using resolution 6
algorithms that aim to solve a conflict as quickly as possible rather than using the
‘shortest-way-out’ strategy used here. Research in this direction is already being
conducted at TU Delft as an extension to [52].
6.2.4. Reference Traffic Scenarios
Fast-timesimulationshavebecomeubiquitousinATCresearchforanalysisandde-
signpurposes,andtheyhavebeenusedinalltechnicalchaptersofthisthesis. The
conclusionsdrawnusingthisapproachare,tosomedegree,dependentonthetraf-
fic scenarios considered. However, despite the popularity of fast-time simulations,
methods to generate standardized traffic scenarios have not been studied in detail
inthepast. ThismakesitverydifficulttoevencomparetheresultsofidenticalATC
studies that have used fast-time simulations.
To overcome this issue, it is recommended to develop a library of reference traffic
scenarios. Such a library should contain a multitude of scenarios for different use
cases,giventhewiderangeofoperationalsettingsanalyzedusingsimulations. For
example,differentsetsofscenarioswouldbeneededtoevaluatetheperformances
of high altitude en route airspaces when compared to those needed for low alti-
tude terminal airspaces. In addition to specifying origin-destination pairs, these
reference scenarios should also specify default traffic demand volumes that take
into account the predicted growth of air traffic in the future. If the methods used
to generate reference scenarios are made open-source, then they can be continu-
ously updated as the needs of the research community change, for example when
new aircraft types are introduced. In addition to making research more compara-

ble, reference traffic scenarios would also make the results of simulation studies
more transparent. This recommendation is inspired by the goals of the AHMED
project.

turedecentralizedoperations. Butitisworthnotingthatsomeaspectsofthisthesis

Becauseconflictchainreactionscanalsooccurintoday’smodeofoperations,itmay

research should be preceded by a human-in-the-loop study that uses experienced

operational conditions, and for a wide range traffic demands.
6.2.6. Societal Impact of this Research
Despite the capacity constraints faced by today’s centralized ATC system, in the
short-term, decentralized control is unlikely to be applied towards improving com-
mercialairtransportoperationsforbothtechnicalaswellaspoliticalreasons. How-
ever, the decentralized ATC concept is unlikely to be confined to the research do-
main for much longer thanks to the rapid emergence of unmannedandpersonal
aerialvehicles. The incredible traffic volumes forecasted for these new aircraft
types, and theclean sheetapproachto ATCthatis requiredto facilitate theiroper-
ation, has provided the incentives necessary for aviation authorities to investigate
some important aspects of decentralization, such as self-separation (referred to as
‘detect and avoid’ by the unmanned community), for the growing field of urban
airspace design. Recent publications outlining the latest plans for urban airspaces
confirm that this is indeed the case [55, 56]. Because of the generic nature of the
airspace designs and the quantitative safety and capacity models discussed in this
thesis, the results of this work can be generalized beyond the specific conditions
that have been considered here, for instance for the lower speeds anticipated for
unmanned traffic. Therefore, the methods developed in this thesis to analyze and
modelthecapacityofdecentralizedATCcouldbeusefultowardsthedesignofnew
concepts that enable low altitude urban air transport operations.

Conclusions
Based on the results presented in the preceding chapters, the following final con-
clusions are drawn in relation to the three open problems that have limited the
further development of the decentralized Air Traffic Control (ATC) concept, namely
airspace design, safety modeling and capacity modeling:
OnAirspaceDesign
1. Capacityfordecentralizationismaximizedwhenalayeredairspacedesignis
usedto separate traffic with different travel directions at different flight lev-
els. Thisairspacedesignimprovesperformanceovercompletelyunstructured
airspacebydecreasingtheaverageconflictprobabilitybetweenaircraft,while
allowing flexible routing in the horizontal direction.
2. Over-constrainingthehorizontalpathsofaircraftcantriggerartificialtraffic
concentrationsattheintersectionsofstructuralelementsandreduceairspace
capacity. Therefore, horizontal constraints should be avoided as much as
possible, unless they can be tailored to match the observed horizontal traffic
demand pattern.
3. Robustnesstouncertaintiesissignificantlyreducedwhendecentralizationus-
ingtime-basedseparationiscombinedwithapredefinedandfixedthree-
dimensionalroutestructure. For such airspace designs, uncertainties, such
as wind and rogue aircraft, can cause unintended conflicts and intrusions,
which in turn reduce airspace safety and capacity.

214 7. Conclusions
OnSafetyModeling
4. Theintrinsicsafetyprovidedbyanairspacedesignisinfluencedbythenumber
ofcombinationsoftwoaircraftandtheaverageconflictprobabilitybetween
anytwoaircraft. Both factors are affected by the constraints imposed by
a particular airspace design, and such models are often referred to as ‘gas
models’ in literature.
5. Whenmodelingtheoverallintrinsicsafetyprovidedbyanairspacedesign,it
isessentialtotakeintoaccounttheinteractionsthatoccurbetweenaircraftin
allflightphases, and not just those between cruising aircraft. This is partic-
ularly important for layered airspaces as the proportion of conflicts involving
climbing/descending aircraft increases as the heading range per flight level
decreases.
6. Analyticalgasmodelsassume‘ideal’trafficscenarioproperties,andaccuracy
ishighfortheidealcase.Butaccuracydecreasesfornon-idealtrafficscenar-
ios, and it is the lowest for non-ideal altitude and spatial distributions.
7. Numerical‘adjustments’canbeusedtogeneralizegasmodelsandincrease
theiraccuracyfornon-idealtrafficscenarios. The adjustments apply to both
factors of gas models, and this approach increased accuracy for non-ideal
scenarios to the levels found with the analytical model for the ideal traffic
scenario.
OnCapacityModeling

8. TheCapacityAssessmentMethodforDecentralizedATC(CAMDA)definesthe
maximumtheoreticalcapacityoftheairspaceasthetrafficdensityatwhich
conflictchainreactionsbecomeuncontrollable. Because conflict chain reac-
tions are central to the CAMDA capacity definition, this approach implicitly
takes into account the safety and efficiency of travel when estimating capac-
ity.
9. CAMDAisasemi-empiricalmethod, but all its parameters have a physical
interpretation. Consequently, the effect of a number of factors on capacity
can be directlyunderstood from the structureof the underlying models. This
in turn allows for a more systematic selection of the experimental conditions
requiredwhencomparingdifferentairspacedesignsand/orCD&Ralgorithms
in terms of capacity.
10. ThecapacityofdecentralizedATCisdependentonboththeselectedairspace
designandtheselectedCD&Ralgorithm. Here airspace design affects the
safety and efficiency of the planned flight routes, whereas CD&R algorithm
contributestothesafetyandefficiencyoftheactuallyflownroutes. Therefore,
an optimization of capacity requires an optimization of both airspace design
andCD&Ralgorithm,aswellasanoptimizationofthepairingbetweenthem.

Traffic Scenario Generation
Fast-time simulations have been used throughout this thesis for two main pur-
poses. In chapter 2, simulations were used to empirically study the dynamics of
decentralizedairtrafficoperationsforthespecificpurposeofanalyzingtheairspace
structure-capacity relationship. Chapters 3-5, on the other hand, used simulations
tovalidatethequantitativesafetyandcapacitymodelsdevelopedinthiswork. Be-
cause of this versatility, fast-time simulations have become extremely common as
atoolforanalysisanddesignpurposesinAirTrafficControl(ATC)research.
In addition to modeling aircraft systems and kinematics, to perform fast-time sim-
ulations, it is necessary to generate traffic scenarios. Simply put, traffic scenarios
describethecreationtimes,deletiontimes,androutesofallaircraftinasimulation.
In other words, traffic scenarios represent the input conditions used by fast-time
simulations to numerically calculate and propagate the motion of aircraft.
The goal of this appendix is to describe the design of the traffic scenario genera-
tor that has been developed for this thesis. Even though fast-time simulations are
ubiquitous in ATC research, as of the writing of this thesis, there are no standard-
ized procedures to generate scenarios, and different studies have used different
methods to produce scenarios (and these are often not well documented). For
this reason, traffic scenario generation continues to be, unfortunately, more of an
‘art’ than a ‘science’. Consequently, some of the design choices discussed in this
appendixarebasedonwhathasbeenfoundto‘work’inpractice,oftenusingtrial-
and-error,forthespecificneedsofthisstudy. Forthisreason,thisappendixshould
not be viewed as a comprehensive guide on traffic scenario generation; it simply
describesthescenariogenerationprocessusedhereforthesakeofcompleteness.
Nonetheless, to make the descriptions that follow tangible, the scenarios used in
chapter 5 are used as an illustrative example (other chapters use identical traffic
scenario generators).

The scenario generator makes use of the following five assumptions. These as-
sumptions can also be viewed as baseline design choices.

The scope of this thesis is limited to decentralized en route operations; see sec-

ofaircraftwithinenrouteairspaces. Inotherwords,take-off,initialclimb,finalde- A
scend and landing flight phases are not taken into account.
Three-DimensionalScenariosandFlightProfiles
Although only the trajectories of aircraft in en route airspaces are considered, the
approach used here produces three-dimensional scenarios. Therefore, all aircraft
flight profiles consist of: 1) a climbing segment through so a called transition
airspacethatisassumedtoexistbetweenlow-altitudecentralizedandhigh-altitude
decentralized airspaces; 2) a cruising segment towards the destination; and 3) a
descendingphasetoexitfromdecentralizedenrouteairspace. FigureA.2displays
an example aircraft flight profile which consists of these three segments.
ConstantDensityScenarios
The scenarios produced herebuilds up traffic volumefromzeroto a desired value,
afterwhichtrafficdensityismaintainedatthedesiredvalue;seeFigureA.3. Conse-
quently,thescenarioshavetobecombinedwithanexperimentdesignthatutilizes
multiple traffic demand levels if the rate of change of a dependent variable, such
as safety and efficiency metrics, with density needs to be evaluated. The method
usedheretodefinemultipletrafficdemandlevelsisdescribedinsectionA.6.
FiniteAirspaceVolume
All simulated traffic are assumed to fly within a predefined and finite volume of
airspace. Thisimpliesthatthecreationanddeletionpointsofallaircraftarelocated
within this predefined volume, i.e., aircraft do notfly outside the boundaries of
the simulated sector. In fact the scenario generator expects aircraft to be deleted
as they descend through the lower boundary of the simulated sector in order to
maintain traffic density at the desired level.
OfflineScenarioGeneration
To ensure that all experiment conditions, for example all tested conflict detection
settings,aresubjectedtothesametrafficdemandpatterns,allscenariosneedtobe
generatedofflinepriortotheactualsimulations. Therefore,thescenariogenerator
converts the computed aircraft routes into text files which can subsequently be
loadedintotheselectedairtrafficfast-timesimulatorduringrun-time. Inthisstudy,
theTMXandBlueSkyfast-timesimulatorshavebeenused. Bothsimulatorsexpect
the same scenario file format, and use the same scenario commands. Section A.8
describes how the scenarios produced here should be converted to text files such
that they can be used by these two ATC simulators.
A.3. Input Parameters
In addition to the above assumptions, several input parameters are expected by
thescenariogenerator. ThesearelistedinTableA.1,alongwiththecorresponding
valuesusedbythetrafficscenariosofchapter5. Mostoftheseparametersareused
forsizingthephysicalenvironmentofthesimulations;seesectionA.4. Additionally,
all parameters related to densities are used to define the specific traffic demand
scenarios required for simulation; see section A.6 for more details.

A.4. Design of Physical Environment
The first step of the scenario generation process is to design the physical envi-
ronment of the simulation. The scenario generation process described here aims
to size a decentralized en route airspace sector similar to the one shown in Fig-
ure A.2.
Intheverticaldirection,thesectorisdividedintwoparts;anupper‘cruising’zone,
and a lower ‘transition’ zone. As the name suggests, aircraft cruise towards their
respectivedestinationsinthecruisingzone. Inthisstudy,theverticalheightofthis
zone is determined based on the number of flight levels used by layered airspace
designs, 𝑁 , and the height of each flight level, 𝜁. The latter parameter is de-
(cid:4959)(cid:4965)
pendent on the the vertical separation requirement, 𝑆 . This is because a design
(cid:4975)
requirement for layered airspaces is that 𝜁 >= 𝑆 in order to prevent conflicts be-
(cid:4975)
tween aircraft cruising in adjacent flight levels. In this work, the maximum value
used for 𝑆 = 1000 ft. Consequently, 𝜁 is set to 1100 ft; the extra 100 ft was re-
(cid:4975)
quired to prevent so called ‘false’ conflicts that can sometimes occur when aircraft
level-offattheirdesiredcruisingaltitude. Becausethelowerandupperboundaries

The transition zone is defined to be the region of airspace between low altitude
centralized airspaces and high altitude decentralized airspaces. In the simulation,
all aircraft are created, or spawned, at the lower boundary of the transition zone.
Subsequently, they climb into the cruising zone. At the end of their flights, aircraft
once again descend through the transition zone. Descending aircraft are deleted
as they cross the lower boundary of the transition zone. The deletion of aircraft
is an important aspect for the scenario generator design considered here; old air-
craft need to be deleted so that traffic density is maintained at the required level
whennewaircraftareintroducedintothesimulation. IntheBlueSkyandTMXATM
simulators, aircraft deletion can be controlled via theAREAcommand.

effectively prevent short term conflicts which can sometimes occur between new
aircraft and aircraft that already cruising. Since the cruising zone has a height of
7700 ft, see Figure A.2, the transition zone was assigned a height of 4000 ft in
chapter 5 (3850 ft rounded to the nearest 1000 ft).
In the horizontal direction, the simulated sector was designed to have a square-
shaped cross-section. Since the starting and end points of all flights are assumed
be located in the simulated sector, see section A.2, horizontal sizing is dependent
on the expected flight distances of aircraft. To ensure that there is sufficient vari-
ation between the possible trajectories of aircraft, the following rule of thumb is
used:
Horizontal Square Length=2 𝐷 (A.2)
(cid:4966)(cid:4962)(cid:4967)
It should be noted that 𝐷 is used for horizontal sizing, and not 𝐷 . This is
(cid:4966)(cid:4962)(cid:4967) (cid:4966)(cid:4954)(cid:4977)
because the horizontal cross-sectional area is directly proportional to the number
ofinstantaneousaircraftsneededtorealizethedesiredtrafficdensities. Therefore,
using 𝐷 would result in an unnecessarily large simulation area, as well as an
(cid:4966)(cid:4954)(cid:4977)

220 A. Traffic Scenario Generation
A unnecessarily large number of instantaneous aircrafts to realize the required den-
sities. This would in turn increase the computational load when performing the
actual fast-time simulations, without any benefits in terms of results.
In the horizontal plane, Figure A.2 shows that the physical environment is divided
into separate ‘simulation’ and ‘experiment’ regions. Although traffic is simulated
throughout the entire simulation region, this distinction is necessary because no
trafficissimulatedoutsidetheconsideredsector. Therefore,aircraftneartheedges
ofthesimulationregionarelesslikelytointeractwithotherflightsrelativetoaircraft
near the center of the sector. To solve this issue, following the simulation design
described in [92], a smaller cylindrical ‘experiment region’ is defined at the center
of the simulation region. The gap between the experiment and simulation regions
needs to be greater than the average conflict detection look-ahead distance so
that aircraft in the experiment region can easily conflict with other aircraft from all
directions. The average look-ahead distance can be computed as:
Gap Between Simulation and Experiment Regions>=𝑉̄𝑡 (A.3)
(cid:4965)
Here, 𝑉̄ is the average speed of all aircraft in the simulation, and 𝑡 is the conflict
(cid:4965)
detection look-ahead time. For the values listed in Table A.1, this results in a look-
aheaddistanceof33.3NM.Correspondingly,thediameteroftheexperimentregion
was selected to be 300 NM, since this results in a gap of 50 NM between the
simulationandexperimentregions. Becauseofthisdesign,onlythepathsofaircraft
within the experiment region, and only conflicts with closest points of approach
within the experiment region, should be considered when analyzing the results of
the simulations.
It should be noted that square and circular shaped cross-sections were selected
arbitrarilyforthesimulationandexperimentregionsforthescenariosusedinchap-
ter5. Thesubsequentstepsofthescenariogeneratorarenotdependentonthese
specific shape choices. The only requirement is that convex shapes are selected
for both regions.
A.5. Scenario Duration
The traffic scenario design described here consists of three phases: a pre-logging
phase, a logging phase, and a ‘run down’ phase; see Figure A.3. To determine the
total duration of a scenario, it is, therefore, necessary to determine the durations
of each of these three component phases.
Scenariosalwaysbeginwithapre-loggingphase. Duringthisphase,trafficvolume
is built up from zero to the desired level. Because aircraft are introduced into the
simulationataconstantrate(seesectionA.6formoredetailsonthis),theamount
of time required to realize the desired traffic density is equivalent to the average
duration of a flight, 𝑡̄ = (cid:4931)̄ . Using the values for 𝑉̄ and 𝐷̄ listed in Table A.1, it

FigureA.3: Thetotalscenariodurationisdividedintothreephases. Theredlineindicatestheactual
trafficvolume,andthegreenlinerepresentsthetargettrafficvolume.
takes approximately 35 minutes to realize the desired traffic demand for the sce-
nario settings used in chapter 5. The duration of the pre-logging phase must be
greater than this value. This is because logging should only commence once the
traffic is allowed to settle at the desired density for some time. This is particu-
larlyimportantforsimulationswhichusetacticalconflictresolutions;thisadditional
buffer is needed to prevent any artificial conflict chain reactions that are triggered
during the traffic volume build up period from skewing the results during the log-
gingphase. Forthisreason,inchapter5,thetotalpre-loggingphaseisselectedto
be 1 hour.
Subsequently, the logging phase can begin. During the logging phase, all relevant
trafficcharacteristicsshouldbeloggedintotextfilesforanalysisafterallexperiment
runs. The duration of the logging phase should be greater than the maximum
flight time of an aircraft in the simulation. For the scenarios used in chapter 5,
the maximum flight time is approximately 40 minutes (computed using the input
parameterslistedinTableA.1). Therefore, thedurationoftheloggingphaseisset
to be 1 hour.
To allow aircraft created at the end of the logging phase to finish their flights, and
thuspreventabnormallyshortflightsfromskewingtheresults,thesimulationends
with a run down phase. As indicated in Figure A.3, traffic demand is held constant
at the required level during the run down phase so that the logs obtained from a
particular simulation can be attributed to a particular traffic density for the entire
duration of a scenario log. This final phase is only required if efficiency related
metricsneedtobeanalyzed. Asfortheloggingphase,thedurationoftherundown
phase must be greater than the maximum flight time. Therefore, the duration of
the run down phase is also set to be 1 hour in chapter 5.

mationofthedurationsofeachsimulationphase. Asexplainedabove,inchapter5,

for a complete scenario. Using this information, and the spawn interval of aircraft

the number of aircraft that need to be simulated during an entire scenario. These
aspects are discussed next.

A.6.1. Traffic Demand Selection
If the goal of an experiment is to empirically study the rate of change of a depen-
dent measure with traffic density, then it is necessary to repeat the simulations for
multipletrafficdemandconditions. Inmostcases,thespanofdensitiesselectedfor
simulationshouldincludetoday’speaktrafficdemand. In2017,themaximumtraf-
fic density in en route airspaces (>=18,000 ft) over the Netherlands was approx-
imately 32 aircraft per 10,000 NM(cid:4796) (computed using logged ADS-B data). There-
fore, ten traffic densities between 5-50 aircraft per 10,000 NM(cid:4796) were selected for
the experiments performed in chapter 5; see Table A.2.

The next step is to compute the number of instantaneous aircraft, 𝑁 , corre-

sponding to the desired traffic demand densities. To do this, the following simple
relationship between 𝑁 , traffic density, 𝜌, and area, 𝐴, is used:

𝑁 =𝜌𝐴 (A.5)

of Figure A.2, and it equals 160,000 NM(cid:4796). Using this approach, the number of
instantaneousaircraftcorrespondingtoeachdemandconditionisalsodisplayedin

A.6.2. Spawn Rate Calculation
As mentioned above, the scenario generator considered here aims to maintain the
desiredtrafficdensityduringtheloggingandrundownphasesofthesimulation,i.e.,
to produce scenarios with density-time profiles matching Figure A.3. To produce
such scenarios, aircraft need to be replaced at the same rate at which they are
deleted. This rate, referred to as the spawn rate, Ω, can be calculated using the
following simple logic. Since 𝑉̄ is the average speed and 𝐷̄ is the average distance
flown by aircraft in the simulation, the average time taken by a flight to cross
the simulation region is 𝑡̄ =
(cid:4931)̄
. Since aircraft are deleted when they fly out of
(cid:4959) (cid:4949)̄
the simulation region, the ratewith which aircraft need to be introduced into the
simulation to ensure that there is always 1 aircraft within the simulation region at
(cid:4949)̄
all times is the inverse of the average flight time, or . Correspondingly, the rate

the following simple expression:
𝑁 =𝑇Ω (A.7)
(cid:4973)(cid:4968)(cid:4973)(cid:4954)(cid:4965)
The spawn interval between each aircraft is equal to the inverse of the spawn
(cid:4795)
rate, i.e,. . The spawn interval can be used to divide the total duration of the
(cid:4886)
simulation, 𝑇, into 𝑁 segments to determine the spawn time of each aircraft.

Becauseaircraftareunlikelytoenterasectorataconstanttimeintervalinreallife,
a uniformly distributed random number, between 0 and half the spawn interval,
can be added to the spawn times of aircraft to reduce the predictability of the
simulation. This ‘spawn time randomization’ was done for all the scenarios used in
this thesis.
A.7. Route Computation
The most important step of the scenario generator is to compute the routes of
all aircraft. Route computation is heavily dependent on the constraints imposed
on traffic motion by an airspace design. Since the vast majority of this thesis has
focused on unstructured and layered airspace designs, this appendix will focus on
route computation for these two direct routing airspace concepts (direct routing in
the horizontal direction).

A.7.1. Origin and Destination Selection
A
As mentioned previously, the origins and destinations of all aircraft are located
within the ‘simulation region’, at the lower boundary of the ‘transition region’; see
Figure A.2. Therefore, any latitude/longitude combination within the simulation
region can be selected as the origin of an aircraft, and random combinations can
be determined using a random number generator. Random number of generators,
of the desired distribution, are also used to determine an aircraft’s heading and
its flight distance. Subsequently, the destination of an aircraft is computed as the
end-point of a straight line that extends from the selected origin, with a length
correspondingtotheselecteddistance,andabearingcorrespondingtotheselected
heading. This can be done using the following geometrical equations:
(cid:4931) (cid:4931)

Here, 𝑙𝑎𝑡 and 𝑙𝑜𝑛 represent latitude and longitude, respectively, whereas 𝐷 and
(cid:4962)
𝜓 are an aircraft’s flight distance and heading, respectively. Additionally, the sub-
(cid:4962)
scripts 𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑔 and 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡 stand for ‘origin’ and ‘destination’.
If the destination computed by the above equation is within the simulation region,
then it can be accepted. If the destination is outside the simulation region, it
has to be discarded. Subsequently, the above process is repeated until a distance
and heading combination is found that results in a destination that is inside the
simulation region.
It should be noted that random number generators describing any distribution can
be used to select origins, headings and destinations. For instance, if a scenario
with normally distributed heading angles is desired, then such a scenario can be
realized by using a normally distributed random number generator when selecting
aircraft headings. The same goes for the distance distribution, which indirectly
affects the altitude distribution of aircraft. This approach was used to produce so
called ‘non-ideal’ traffic scenarios in chapter 4.
To produce scenarios with non-uniform spatial distributions, it is necessary to ap-
ply additional constrains when selecting the origins and destinations of traffic. For
instance,toproducescenarioswithtrafficdensityhotspotsatthecenterofthesim-
ulation region, the origins and destinations of traffic should be distributed within
two concentric rings as shown in Figure A.5. This arrangement of origins and des-
tinations forces aircraft to fly through the center of the simulation region, thereby
creating a traffic density hot spot. By adjusting the radii of the two concentric cir-
cles, the intensity of the hot spot can be controlled; smaller radii result in ‘hotter’
hot spots.

Althoughbothunstructuredandlayeredairspacedesignsusethesamedirecthori-

of aircraft. In unstructured airspace, the cruising altitude of an aircraft, 𝑍 , is
(cid:4974)(cid:4954),(cid:4962)
directly proportional to its trip distance, 𝐷:
(cid:4962)
𝑍 −𝑍
𝑍 =𝑍 + (cid:4966)(cid:4954)(cid:4977) (cid:4966)(cid:4962)(cid:4967) (𝐷 −𝐷 ) (A.9)

(cid:4966)(cid:4954)(cid:4977) (cid:4966)(cid:4962)(cid:4967)
Here, 𝑍 and 𝑍 are the minimum and maximum altitudes allowed for cruis-
(cid:4966)(cid:4962)(cid:4967) (cid:4966)(cid:4954)(cid:4977)
ing aircraft in the simulation. Comparably, 𝐷 and 𝐷 are the minimum and
(cid:4966)(cid:4962)(cid:4967) (cid:4966)(cid:4954)(cid:4977)
maximum trip distances of aircraft in the simulation.
On the other hand, for layered airspaces, the cruising altitude of an aircraft, 𝑍 ,
(cid:4965)(cid:4954)(cid:4978),(cid:4962)
depends on both its heading, 𝜓, and its trip distance, 𝐷, as indicated by the
(cid:4962) (cid:4962)
following heading-altitude rule:
𝐷 −𝐷 𝜓

(cid:4966)(cid:4954)(cid:4977) (cid:4966)(cid:4962)(cid:4967)
Here, 𝛽 is the number of flight levels needed to define one complete set of layers,
and 𝜅 is the number of complete layer sets. These two parameters are defined as
𝛽 = 360(cid:4968)/𝛼 and 𝜅 = 𝐿/𝛽, where 𝐿 is the total number of available flight levels,

equation A.10 uses trip distances to determine cruising altitudes such that short
flights remain at lower altitudes, while longer flights use higher layer sets.
A.7.3. Aircraft Speed
Although not explicitly mentioned in Figure A.4, route computation also involves
selecting the ground speed of each aircraft, 𝑉. Aircraft are required to fly with
(cid:4962)
constant ground speeds throughout their flight. However, different aircraft in the
simulation may have different ground speeds. Similar to the headings and dis-
tances flown by aircraft, the 𝑉 can be selected using a random number generator

isidenticaltothatrequiredtodetermineitsthetopofdescend. Therefore,onlythe
procedure used to determine the top of climb is described below in detail.
To compute the latitude and longitude of the top of climb of an aircraft, it is nec-
essary to know its climb angle, 𝛾 , and its vertical speed, 𝑉 during climb. While
(cid:4956)(cid:4957) (cid:4953),(cid:4962)
the former is an input variable to the scenario generator, see Table A.1, the latter
can be computed using its speed, 𝑉 (determined in the previous step):
(cid:4962)
𝑉 =𝑉sin(𝛾 ) (A.11)
(cid:4953),(cid:4962) (cid:4962) (cid:4956)(cid:4957)

(cid:4953),(cid:4962) (cid:4962) (cid:4956)(cid:4965)(cid:4962)(cid:4966)(cid:4955)
the horizontal distance flown during the climb, 𝐷 , can be computed:

𝐷 = 𝑉𝑡 (A.12b)

Finally, the latitude and longitude of the top of climb location can be computed A
using following two geometrical equations:

Note that the above equations are identical to those used previously to determine
the latitude and longitude of the destination of an aircraft. The only difference is
that 𝐷 is used here instead of the total flight distance, 𝐷.
(cid:4956)(cid:4965)(cid:4962)(cid:4966)(cid:4955),(cid:4962) (cid:4962)
The top of descend can be calculated using a similar approach to that described
above for the top of climb. The only difference is that the procedure should be
appliedbackwardsfromthedestination. Thetopofdescendpointisnotneededfor
experimentswithtacticalconflictresolution. Thisisbecauseconflictresolutionmay
cause aircraft to overshoot their top of descend, and specifying it in a scenario file
may,therefore,causesuchaircrafttoflybackwards. Instead,forcaseswithconflict
resolution, the fast-time simulator should compute the top of descend in real time
based on the actual location of the aircraft with respect to its destination.
A.8. Scenario File Generation
The previous steps of the scenario generator computed all the parameters needed
to describe the complete routes of aircraft, and their spawn times. This final step
describes how these parameters should be written into standardized text files that
can be understood by the BlueSky and TMX fast-time simulators.
A.8.1. Scenario Files
Each scenario file lists the routes and spawn times of all aircraft for one particular
traffic demand case. Both BlueSky and TMX simulators use identical commands
andcommandargumentsforscenarios. TableA.3describesthesixcommandsthat
are necessary to define each aircraft’s route within the context of the scenarios
described here. Figure A.6 shows the implementation of these commands for two
arbitraryflights. Hereitcanbeseenthateachcommandisprecededbythespawn
time of the corresponding aircraft in hh:mm:ss.ss format. Additionally, the top of

A.8.2. Batch Files
A full experiment usually consists of multiple traffic scenarios. To sequentially ex-
ecute all the scenarios of an experiment without manual intervention, the BlueSky
simulator uses so called ‘batch’ files. Batch files contain calls to the scenario and
simulation settings files that are needed for a particular experiment. Figure A.7
displays an example batch file with calls to two arbitrary simulations. These two
runs are repetitions of the same traffic demand, but using different simulation set-
tings.
In Figure A.7, it can be seen that three different commands are used in a batch
file: SCEN, PCALL and HOLD. The SCEN command is used to name a simulation
run, and this name is also used to name the logs of a particular run. For instance
inFigureA.7,thetwosimulationsarenamed‘Scenario-OFF’and‘Scenario-ON’,and
therefore,thelogfilescorrespondingtothesetwosimulationswillalsocontainthe
words ‘Scenario-ON’ and ’Scenario-OFF’.

ThePCALLcommandisusedtoloadthetrafficscenariosandsettingsfiles. Asmen-
tioned above, both simulations shown in Figure A.7 use the same traffic demand
condition,namely,‘INST-80-Rep6’,butusedifferentsettingsfiles. Thefirstsimula-
tionrunusestacticalconflictresolution,andtherefore,thissimulationisperformed
usingthe‘Settings-CRON’settingsfile. Thesecondsimulationdoesnotuseconflict
resolution, and therefore, it is performed using the ‘Settings-CROFF’ settings file.
In addition to activating/deactivating conflict detection and resolution algorithms,
settingsfilescanalsospecifymanyothercharacteristicsofthesimulationincluding
thesimulationtimestep,startandendtimesforlogging,trafficseparationrequire-
mentsandexperimentareadefinitions. Inadditiontoautomatingtheexecutionof
multiple simulation runs in sequence, the ability to repeat identical scenarios with
different settings is a useful feature of the batch mode of BlueSky.
Finally,theHOLDcommandisusedtoindicatethetimeatwhichBlueSkyshouldstop
aparticularsimulationrun,andstartthefollowingrun. Toensurethatasimulation
runisfullycompletedbeforestartingthefollowingrun,theHOLDcommandshould
beexecutedataverylatetime;intheexampleshowninFigureA.7,thecommand
is executed 5 hours and 30 minutes after a simulation has started since all aircraft
are guaranteed to have finished their flights after this duration (for the scenarios
considered here).
A.9. Additional Considerations
TwoDimensionalScenarios
The scenario generator described in this appendix aims to generate three dimen-
sionalscenarios. But,thesamebasicdesigncanalsobeusedtocreatetwodimen-
sionalscenarios,i.e.,scenariosfocusingononlythecruisephaseofflight. Thiscan
be achieved by simply having only one flight level for all cruising traffic. Nonethe-
less,aircraftshouldstillbespawnedataloweraltitudeandberequiredtoclimbinto
the cruising level. Although logging can be restricted to the single cruising flight
level, this approach can prevent very short term conflicts between just spawned
aircraftandpre-existingcruisingtraffic. Onceallaircrafthavefinishedtheirflights,
they can be deleted as they descend below the cruising flight level.

--- Page 251 ---

232 A. Traffic Scenario Generation
A A word of caution; it is the opinion of the author that two dimensional simulations
lead to incomplete conclusions. Therefore, 2-D simulations should only be used
for initial testing purposes, for example, for testing the implementation of a new
conflictresolutionalgorithm. Theyshouldnotbeusedtostudythedynamicsofthe
air traffic system, or to evaluate the safety or capacity of a new airspace design.
Experience has shown that two dimensional simulations oversimplify the actual in-
teractions that occur between aircraft in real life, and that these interactions can
have a significant impact on safety and capacity. For instance, the three dimen-
sional simulations performed in this thesis have shown that climbing/descending
aircrafttriggerthevastmajorityofconflictsinlayeredairspaces(over70%ofcon-
flicts for the conditions tested here). Simulations without climbing/descending air-
craftwould,therefore,significantlyoverestimatethesafetyperformanceoflayered
airspaces.
‘Bouncing-Out’Effect
When performingsimulations with conflict resolution, it is possible that aircraft are
bounced out of the experiment region for part of their flights. Since logging is
only performed in the experiment region, this ‘bouncing-out’ effect can distort the
results. This problem can not be solved completely. But it can be mitigated to
some degree by forcing aircraft to recover to their pre-conflict destination after
resolving a conflict, and by using as large an experiment region as possible within
thesimulationregion;FigureA.2displaysthedifferencebetweenthesetworegions.
Also aircraft should not be deleted if they leave the simulation region horizontally.
They should only be deleted when they leave the simulation region vertically. This
gives a chance for aircraft that are bounced out to re-enter the experiment region
after conflict resolution.
NamingofSimulationRuns
Thelabelsusedtonameasimulationrunshouldclearlyidentifythemostimportant
experiment conditions used by that run. For example, the names used by the two
simulation runs displayed in Figure A.7 clearly indicates whether a particular run
is performed with or without conflict resolution. This is because, in most cases,
the logs of a simulation run assume the same name as the simulation run itself.
Therefore,thisapproachtonamingsimulationrunsmakesitmucheasiertoanalyze
the results of a simulation during post-processing.
ActivationofConflictResolutionAlgorithms
If tactical conflict resolution is used, it should be activated right from the start of a
scenario, and not just before the logging phase begins. This is because a sudden
activation of conflict resolution can trigger artificial conflict chain reactions, which
can in turn negatively affect the results of an experiment. Moreover, it is more
realistic to activate conflict resolution right from the start of a scenario.
ScenarioRepetitions
Becauseeachscenariorepresentsonlyoneofmanypossiblerealizationsofatraffic
demandcondition,eachdemandconditionhastoberepeatedmultipletimesusing
different origin-destination combinations. As a rule of thumb, the number of repe-

Samenvatting
Het huidige systeem van luchtverkeersleiding (LVL) is gebaseerd op een gecentra-
liseerde besturingsarchitectuur. Fundamenteel is dit systeem sterk afhankelijk van
handmatig ingrijpen door menselijke luchtverkeersleiders (LVLDs) om veilige ope-
ratiestegaranderen. Decapaciteitvanditsysteemisdaaromnauwverbondenmet
demaximalewerklastdiedoorLVLDsgetolereerdkanworden. Hoewelditsysteem
tot nu toe heeft voorzien in de behoeften van de luchtvaart, wijzen de wereld-
wijdemeldingenvantoenemendevertragingenencongestiesamenmethettekort
aan LVLDs, welke de werkdruk van de LVLDs nog verergert, erop dat het huidige
gecentraliseerde operationele model snel zijn maximale capaciteit nadert.
Omdevoorspeldetoenameinverkeersdruktehethoofdtebieden,hebbenveelon-
derzoekers een overgang voorgesteld naar een paradigma van gedecentraliseerde
verkeersscheiding in het en-route luchtruim. In dit gedecentraliseerde luchtruim is
elk afzonderlijk vliegtuig verantwoordelijk voor zijn eigen separatie met al het om-
ringende verkeer. Om decentralisatie mogelijk te maken, zijn aanzienlijke onder-
zoeken gewijd aan de ontwikkeling van nieuwe algoritmen voor geautomatiseerde
conflictdetectie en -oplossing in de lucht (CD&O), waarbij sommige studies zelfs
dergelijke algoritmen testen met echte vliegtuigbemanningen.
Ondanksmeerdantweedecenniaaanonderzoekdatdetheoretischevoordelenlaat
zien, moet decentralisatie echter nog worden ingezet in het veld. Vanuit technisch
oogpunt heeft een gebrek aan inzicht in drie open vraagstukken, namelijk het ont-
werp,demodelleringvandeveiligheid,endemodelleringvandecapaciteitvanhet
luchtruim, de verdere ontwikkeling en uitvoering ervan belemmerd. Het doel van
ditonderzoekisomdezedrieproblemenaantepakkenomgedecentraliseerdeLVL
dichter bij de realiteit te brengen. Daarom is de centrale deel van dit proefschrift
verdeeldindriedelen,waarbijelkdeeleenvandedriebovengenoemdeproblemen
aanpakt.

liseerd luchtruim. Hoewel het huidige gecentraliseerde LVL-systeem in elementen
zoals luchtwegen en sectoren gebruikt in het ontwerp, is door eerdere studies nog
nietindetailonderzochthoehetgebruikvanvergelijkbareoptiesgedecentraliseerde
operaties kan optimaliseren. Er bestaat zelfs geen consensus in de bestaande lite-
ratuur omtrent de vraag of een bepaalde vorm van verkeersstructuur ook gunstig
is voor gedecentraliseerde LVL, waarbij verschillende studies over dit onderwerp
lijnrechttegenovergesteldeconclusieshebben. Omeenbeterbegriptekrijgenvan
de relatie tussen het ontwerp van het luchtruim en de capaciteit van gedecentra-

De resultaten van deze simulaties waren hoogst onverwacht: aangezien eerdere
studies zich hadden gericht op alleen volledig ongestructureerde en volledig ge-
structureerde luchtruimontwerpen, werd verondersteld dat een van deze twee ex-
treme ontwerpopties tot de hoogste capaciteit zou leiden. De simulatieresultaten
gaven echter aan dat een gelaagd luchtruimontwerp, dat voorschriften van koers-
hoogte gebruikte om kruisende vliegtuigen verticaal te scheiden op basis van hun
reisrichting,resulteerdeindebestebalansvanallestatistiekeninhetluchtruimdie
inoverwegingwerdengenomen. Dezebenaderingvanhetorganiserenvanhetver-
keer verlaagde niet alleen de relatieve snelheden tussen vliegtuigen, maar liet ook
directe horizontale routes toe. Als zodanig leidde het gelaagde luchtruimconcept
tot de hoogste veiligheid van alle geteste ontwerpen, zonder de route-efficiëntie
ten opzichte van het volledig ongestructureerde ontwerp onnodig te verminderen.
Deze laatste ontwerpoptie resulteerde in de op één na beste capaciteit. In tegen-
stelling tot dit, zorgden concepten die het verkeer strikte horizontale beperkingen
oplegdenvooreenonevenwichttussendeopgelegdestructuurenhetpatroonvan
het verkeer. Dit leidde op zijn beurt tot kunstmatige concentraties van verkeer
die de algemene prestaties en capaciteit verminderden. Samenvattend verbeterde
de capaciteit van decentralisatie toen structurele beperkingen een verlaging van
de relatieve snelheden bevorderden en wanneer directe horizontale routes waren
toegestaan.
Het tweede deel van dit proefschrift ontwikkelde wiskundige conflictmodellen die
deintrinsiekeveiligheidvaneenluchtruimontwerpkwantificeerden,metbehulpvan
casestudy’s met ongestructureerde en gelaagde luchtruimconcepten. Hier verwijst
het begrip van intrinsieke veiligheid naar het vermogen van een luchtruimontwerp
om conflicten te voorkomen, alleen door de beperkingen die het oplegt aan het
verkeer. De modellen die hier worden behandeld, worden in de literatuur vaak
’gasmodellen’ genoemd. Zoalsde naam al aangeeft, behandelt deze modellerings-
methodeconflictentussenvliegtuigendielijkenopdebotsingendie zichvoordoen

Dit proefschrift breidt daarom de gasmodellen zodanig uit dat ze rekening houden
met de effecten van zowel kruisend als klimmend/dalend verkeer op het aantal
getelde conflicten. De ontwikkelde methode groepeerde vliegtuigen door middel
van de vluchtfase, terwijl ook rekening werd gehouden met de interacties, evenals
het aandeel van vliegtuigen, in verschillende vluchtfasen. Dit werd gecombineerd
met een eenvoudige, maar nieuwe methode om zowel de horizontale als verticale
componenten van de gewogen gemiddelde relatieve snelheid in het luchtruim te
berekenen. Experimenten met versnelde tijd toonden aan dat de resulterende 3D-

te onderzoeken wat de effecten van zulke aannames van scenario’s hebben op de
nauwkeurigheidvanhetanalytischgasmodelmetbehulpvanversneldesimulaties.
Daarnaast ontwikkelde en testte dit werk zogenaamde numerieke ‘modelaanpas-
singen’ die de afhankelijkheid van de modellen op de aannames van het scenario
versoepelden. Net als voorheen werden conflictmodellen voor ongestructureerde
en gelaagde luchtruimten gebruikt als casestudy’s voor deze doeleinden.
De resultaten van deze versnelde simulaties gaven aan dat niet-ideale hoogte en
ruimtelijkeverdelingen vanhet verkeereen drastischnegatief effecthadden op de
analytischenauwkeurigheidvanhetmodel,terwijlniet-idealekoersverdelingeneen
kleiner negatief effect hadden. Daarentegen had de verdeling van de grondsnel-
heid geen betekenisvolle invloed op het aantal conflicten voor de hier beschouwde
ontwerpen van het luchtruim. Het effect nam echter wel toe in omvang, omdat
het koersbereik per vliegniveau afnam voor gelaagd luchtruim. De simulatieresul-
taten gaven ook aan dat de numerieke modelaanpassingen die in dit proefschrift
zijnontwikkeld,denauwkeurigheidvandemeerrealistischescenario’sverbeterden

van het ideale scenario. Naast een fysiek inzicht in de factoren die de intrinsieke
luchtruimveiligheid beïnvloeden, kunnen de aangepaste conflictmodellen daarom
ook worden gebruikt als hulpmiddelen bij het ontwerpen van luchtruim.
Het derde en laatste deel van dit proefschrift ontwikkelde een kwantitatieve me-
thode om de maximale capaciteit van gedecentraliseerde luchtruimconcepten te
bepalen. De methode die hier wordt behandeld, genaamd Capaciteit evAluatie
Methode voor geDecentraliseerde LVL (‘Capacity Assessment Method for Decen-
tralized ATC’ (CAMDA)), definieert capaciteit als de verkeersdichtheid waarbij zich
ketens van conflicten ongecontroleerd door het gehele luchtruim voortbewegen.
Deze kritische dichtheid werd geïdentificeerd met behulp van een semi-empirische
benadering,waarbijanalytischemodellendiedeintrinsiekeveiligheidvaneenlucht-
ruimontwerp beschrijven, worden gecombineerd met empirische modellen die de
actiesvanCD&O-algoritmenbeschrijven. Omdatketenvanconflictenzoweldevei-

capaciteit als een intrinsieke eigenschap van het luchtruim.

kan de CAMDA-methode, naast het verschaffen van een vergelijkende capaciteit-
smeetwaarde,ookwordengebruiktomsystematischdeexperimenteleconditieste
selecteren die nodig zijn om de maximale capaciteitslimiet van gedecentraliseerde
luchtruimontwerpen te beoordelen.
Hoewel de veiligheids- en capaciteitsmodellen die in dit werk zijn ontwikkeld, zich
hebben gericht op ongestructureerde en gelaagde luchtruimontwerpen, is het be-
langrijk om te beseffen dat de onderliggende modelleringsmethoden ook van toe-
passing zijn op andere concepten van een luchtruim. Bij elke aanpassing moet
worden geanalyseerd hoe de beperkingen die een bepaald luchtruimontwerp op-
legt, het aantal mogelijke combinaties van twee vliegtuigen beïnvloedt, alsook de
gemiddelde conflictkans tussen twee vliegtuigen. Dit laatste omdat deze twee ba-
sisfactoren het startpunt zijn voor alle veiligheids- en capaciteitsmodellen die hier
worden besproken. Uitbreidingen van de modellen voor andere luchtruimontwer-
pen zijn een interessante manier om verder onderzoek te doen.

als het weer, op capaciteit te beoordelen, vormt daarom een ander interessant
onderwerp voor verdere analyse.
Ten slotte is het noodzakelijk om de praktische toepassingen van dit onderzoek
te overwegen. Voordat de luchtvaartautoriteiten, welke gefocust zijn op veilig-
heid, overtuigd kunnen worden van een radicale transformatie van het luchtruim-
ontwerp voor kruisende vliegtuigen van een gecentraliseerd naar een gedecentra-
liseerd vorm, is het waarschijnlijk dat er meer praktische ervaring moet worden
opgedaan met gedecentraliseerde LVL. Dankzij de snelle opkomst van onbemande
en persoonlijke vliegtuigen, kan het mogelijk zijn om dit in de nabije toekomst
zo praktisch mogelijk te maken. De ongelooflijke verkeersvolumes die voor deze
nieuwe vliegtuigtypen zijn voorspeld, en het ontwerp vanaf een compleet lege pa-
gina van de LVL die nodig is om hun activiteiten te vergemakkelijken, hebben de
luchtvaartautoriteitendenodigeprikkelsgegevenombelangrijkeaspectenvande-
centralisatie, zoals zelfscheiding, voor het ontwerp van het groeiend gebied van
stedelijk luchtruim. Vanwege de generieke aard van de ontwerpen van luchtruim
en van de kwantitatieve veiligheids- en capaciteitsmodellen die in dit proefschrift
worden besproken, kunnen de resultaten van dit werk worden veralgemeniseerd
boven de specifieke omstandigheden die hier zijn overwogen. Bijvoorbeeld voor
de lagere snelheden die verwacht worden voor onbemande vliegtuigen. Daarom
zouden op korte termijn de methoden die in dit proefschrift zijn ontwikkeld om de
capaciteit van gedecentraliseerde ATC te analyseren en te modelleren, nuttig kun-
nen zijn bij het ontwerpen van nieuwe concepten die de luchtvaart in stedelijke
omgevingen op lage hoogte mogelijk maken.

Deciding to pursue a PhD at C&S was an easy decision for me; I jumped at the
chance as soon as it was presented! Looking back, this period of my life has been
veryimportanttomeonbothapersonalandacademiclevel. Inadditiontostudying
and working at a world renowned university, I’ve had opportunities afforded to
very few; from working with well-known scientists and engineers as part of the
pan-European Metropolis project, to the immensely satisfying and productive mini
‘sabbatical’ at ENAC Toulouse. None of this would have been possible without the

momentthatyouhadduringthepreliminaryMScthesispresentationofMartijnTra
whenyoucameupwiththeinitialideasneededtoderivetheconflictcountmodels
developed in this thesis. I also want to thank you for initiating, and continuously
contributing to the BlueSky ATM simulator, which was used for most of the fast-
time simulations performed in this thesis. Aside from academic aspects, I also
learnt many useful life lessons from Jacco, most importantly time management.
It still amazes me how you find the time to be actively involved in research and
coding BlueSky while also having a full teaching schedule throughout the year.
Your excitement for ATM research has been contagious, and I am sure that many
lifelessonsandtechnicalskillsthatIlearntfromyouwillcontinuetohelpmeinmy
future career and life.
I also want to deeply thank my daily supervisor and co-promotor Dr. ir. Joost
Ellerbroek. In addition to performing the tasks of a daily supervisor, Joost was like
an‘academicbigbrother’tome. Andlikeallgoodbigbrothers,Joostusedhisown
previous experiences to help me avoid many mistakes, and helped me to safely
navigatethroughthechallengingPhDprocess. Hisadviceonhowtowritescientific

One of the most enjoyable aspects of my PhD was the chance to be part of the
Metropolis project back in 2014. Metropolis was my first exposure to the ATM
world, and I learned a lot about ATM research by being part of this project. The
project even contributed heavily towards the 2nd chapter of this thesis. Because
of this, I would like to specially thank everyone involved in the project: Jacco and
Joost from TU Delft; Frank, Dennis, Roalt Pim, and Marieke from the NLR; Andrija,
Daniel and Georges from ENAC; and Oliver and Stefan from DLR. The project was
only a success because of the commitment that all of you showed.
I am extremely grateful to both Dr. Andrija Vidosavljevic and to Prof. dr. Daniel
Delahaye for inviting me for a mini three month sabbatical at ENAC in Toulouse,
France, towards the end of the PhD. Toulouse and ENAC were a very welcome
change of scenery that helped me to focus and finish the technical components of
my research. I also met many friendly fellow researchers at ENAC that made my
stay very enjoyable and lively, most notably Ruixin Wang and Ji Ma, with whom I
had many fun Friday evening trips to the city center. I also remember with great
fondnessthemanyinterestingconversationsthatAndrijaandIhadduringthevery
delicious lunch breaks at ENAC, and the truly wonderful hike organized by Daniel
through the Pyrenees, something I would have never done on my own. You were

At a recent C&S pub quiz, one of the questions was: “Who is the most important
person at C&S?”. The answer was of course, without a doubt, our very friendly
and efficient group secretary Bertine Markus. You can always be confident that if
Bertine is on the job, it will be done very well and quickly! Over the years, Bertine
was always happy to help me through the bureaucracy of being an international
student,andhasalsowrittencountless‘student-proof’lettersonmybehalf. Thank

never heard of another case where this has happened, and I am truly appreciative
all the time you spent helping me, especially to derive the conflict count models
presented in chapter 3. I also had the very good fortune of supervising several
other talented MSc students, all of whom have contributed in some shape or form
tothisthesis(inchronologicalorder): DennisMischon,MartijnTra,ThomLangejan,
Suthes Balasooriyan and Ólafur Þórðarson.
A very interesting side-task that I had during the PhD was to be the C&S repre-

me to translate the summary of this thesis to Dutch.
Last, but certainly not least, I thank my parents and my little brother. You have
always supported me unconditionally through all walks of life, instilled all that is
