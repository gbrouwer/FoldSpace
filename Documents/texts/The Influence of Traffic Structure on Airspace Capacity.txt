II. AIRSPACE CONCEPTS
To empirically study the structure-capacity relationship,
four en-route airspace concepts of increasing structure, named
Full Mix, Layers, Zones and Tubes, have been defined. This
section describes the conceptual design of the four concepts.
A. Full Mix
The Full Mix airspace concept can be most aptly described
as ‘unstructured airspace’. As demand is often unstructured,
the Full Mix concept assumes that any structuring of traffic
decreases overall system efficiency, and that safety is actually
improved by the spreading of traffic over the available Figure 2: Top down view of the Zones topology. Given the personal air

concept somewhat resembles the airway based airspace design
used today.
As a personal aerial transportation scenario is used in this
work, the Zones topology takes into account the layout of
urban environments in the design of its structure, see Figure 2.
Here, two major zone types can be seen: circular and radial
zones. Circular zones are used in a similar way to ring roads
in contemporary cities, while the radial zones facilitate travel
towards and away from the city center, and function as
connections between the circular zones. Additionally, both
zone types are defined to be unidirectional to further aid
traffic separation. As there is no vertical segmentation of
airspace in this concept, optimum altitudes are selected based

packing of tubes in the topology.
3) Self-Separation Automation
The Full Mix, Layers and Zones concepts relied on self-
separation automation for tactical separation, consisting of
separate Conflict Detection (CD), Conflict Resolution (CR)
and Conflict Prevention (CP) modules. CD was performed
through linear extrapolation of aircraft positions over a
prescribed ‘look-ahead’ time. Once conflicts were predicted,
the Modified Voltage Potential (MVP) algorithm is used for
CR in a pair wise fashion, resulting in implicit cooperative
resolution strategies. Finally, the CP algorithm ensures that
aircraft do not turn into conflicts, in an effort to mitigate
conflict chain reactions. Previous research showed that this

Based on initial test runs, a look-ahead time of 60 seconds,
and separation margins of 0.135 Nmi horizontally and 150 ft
vertically, were selected. Also, aircraft were assumed to have
perfect knowledge of the states of neighboring traffic to focus
exclusively on the structure-capacity relationship.
4) Wind
Wind was modeled as a uniform and time-invariant vector
field with random direction and speed. Wind was deliberately
omitted from the simulation's trajectory planning functions to
study the effect of uncertainties, which could cause deviations
from the planned trajectory, on safety. Thus, the wind used in Figure 4: Map of fictional city used as the simulation physical environment.
