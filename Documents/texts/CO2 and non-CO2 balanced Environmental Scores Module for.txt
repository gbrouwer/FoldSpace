Abstract. The SESAR2020 exploratory research (ER4) programme CREATE (Grant 890898)
developed a climate and weather aware Concept of Operations (ConOps) which encompasses a
multi-aircraft 4D trajectory optimisation framework, which utilises a CO and non-CO balanced
2 2
Environmental Scores Module (ESM) for the en-route flight phase. The ESM provides a
computational method to evaluate the “greenness” of aircraft trajectories. Some components
related to the internal ESM scoring are based on expert judgement, which is in line with the
technology readiness level (TRL) 1 of the solution. Fast-time simulations were performed to
demonstrate the proof-of-concept of the ESM in a multi-aircraft tactical optimisation scenario in
the North-Atlantic region. The results show that, because of the simplicity of the metric, the ESM
could be well used for trajectory optimisation and tactical replanning, and most likely as well as
flight and ATC sector environmental performance evaluations.
1. Introduction
Aviation has a responsibility to mitigate its climate impact to improve the long-term sustainability of its
operations and to contribute to the global effort towards reduction of human impact on climate changes.
Although much research is ongoing towards the understanding of CO and non-CO impacts of aviation,
2 2
key stakeholders such as airlines, service providers, and regulators are struggling to translate this
knowledge into pragmatic metrics which can be used to incentivise reduced climate-impact flight
operations.
In the context of CREATE, a SESAR 2020 exploratory research project, a potential SESAR solution
was proposed aiming at the revision and update process of the reference business trajectory in the
particular case of scenarios disrupted by severe weather conditions, and taking into account the
environmental impact of the operations (CREATE-SOL-2). In this context, an air traffic control (ATC)
decision support tool (DST) was proposed in line with the SESAR extended ATC planning (EAP) and
integrated network for (extended) ATC planning (INAP) concepts. The basic idea behind CREATE-
SOL-2 is that, during the execution of a flight, several alternative trajectories might be proposed by the
airspace user in order to avoid weather hazards or climate sensitive volumes using the most up-to-date
weather and environmental impact information available. Then, for each alternative trajectory, an
environmental score is computed and used by the DST to inform ATC and to support the selection of
the best avoidance trajectory for each concerned flight to find a system-wide optimum [1].
Hence, the Environmental Scores Module (ESM) was proposed and identified as a candidate SESAR
solution by itself (CREATE-SOL-3), since it might be embedded in other air traffic management (ATM)
systems and/or be used with other trajectory look-ahead times (such as for instance for flight dispatching
or air traffic flow management purposes). The ESM specifically addresses the CO and non-CO effects
2 2
during the en-route flight phase. The solution is used to evaluate the “green” performance of aircraft

trajectories related to flight and ATC sector environmental performance which is useful in performance
dashboards for airlines and ATC service providers. In the CREATE fast-time simulation experiment the
ESM was used within the trajectory optimisation framework to rank the candidate flight trajectories
which are then used by a trajectory selector module to select the overall solution, depending on the user-
based decisions between operational cost and delays vs environmental performance in the decision
support tool module.
The ESM is the core of this solution and it assigns scores to each candidate trajectory. It considers non-
CO emissions, which are dependent of location and time, and CO emissions, which are independent of
2 2
location and time. Therefore, CO and non-CO emissions are treated differently in the ESM. This paper
2 2
focuses in the ESM and explains the methodology followed and rationale behind to build these
environmental scores. Some illustrative examples are also given corresponding to fast-time simulations
of flights crossing the North-Atlantic, which were used to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of the ESM.
2. The CREATE SOL-2 framework
Figure 1 shows the different modules that compose the CREATE SOL-2 concept, along with their high-
level interactions. The Meteorological data provider (MDP) and the Thunderstorm and contrail-
zone predictor (TCP) are external providers to the proposed Decision Support system. The active
reference business trajectories (aRBTs) (i.e., the last update of the RBT for each flight), which
basically represents the traffic demand, the sector definition (SD) and the sector capacities (SC) are
available on ground and transferred to the airspace users (AUs) if required.
After these first modules, which aim at providing the initial input data, the next module is the Aircraft
Filtering Process (ADP), in charge of filtering the flights of the indicated area of interest (AoI) and also
the flights which cross any thunderstorm or contrail area. All flights included in the AoI will be
considered, but the alternative trajectories will be requested only for the flights crossing some weather
conflicting area.
The Trajectory Optimisation (TO) module aims at simulating the AUs behaviour when they have to
provide alternative trajectories. The main goal of this module is to provide the alternative
trajectories that avoid the thunderstorm and contrails while minimising the impact to the airspace users.
Within CREATE, these alternative trajectories are modelled considering BADA4 and BADA 3.9 for
the Aircraft Performance Model (APM). The output of this module is the set of all alternative
trajectories of all flights crossing the area of interest. These trajectories are supposed to be sent to the
ground-based ATC DST in from of extended flight plan, i.e., list of waypoints with an associated time
of arrival.
Once all trajectories (in from of flight plan) are available, they are shared with the Trajectory
performance reconstruction (TPR). The purposes of this TPR are to reconstruct the full trajectory
from the flight plan, the creation of the trajectory sector list (TSL) that each trajectory is crossing and
to estimate the required performance data in order to be able to estimate the emissions of the indicated
trajectories (initial and alternative) in a later module. This module is called Trajectory Emissions
Calculator (TEC), which uses the available data of the engines for the estimation of the emissions.
Then, the Environmental Scores Method (ESM) module translates those emissions into
environmental scores which allows us to consider the environmental impact of all trajectories.
Once all the initial/alternative trajectories are available together with their environmental score, their
sector crossing list and the sector capacities are given, the Trajectory Selector (TS) is deployed. This
module aims at choosing one trajectory for each flight at the same time it ensures that the demand is
below the capacity for all the available sectors and contrail zones in the area of interest. Note that the
contrail zone is considered as an artificial sector with a given capacity in order to limit the amount of
flight in the region.

Finally, there is the Decision Making and Pareto Analysis (DMPA). It is possible to run the TS many
times considering different objectives and then evaluate the cross impact between different KPA/KPIs.
Thus, a Pareto analysis can be conducted in order to take conclusions and make decisions. The final
trajectories, along with the allocated delays, are supposed to be communicated to the AUs.

in the CREATE-SOL-2 framework.
3. Methodology to compute the ESM
The ESM for the en-route use-case relies on scoring the candidate trajectories (CT) from the TO module,
based on the expected CO , non-CO emissions and contrail formation potential.
2 2
3.1. Concept
The CO and NO emissions along the (full) flight trajectory of each CT are determined using local
2 x
atmospheric properties, aircraft speed and fuel flow. Weather predictions are used to identify
temporarily contrail sensitive areas. For those parts of the flight trajectory that overlap with
contrail/climate sensitive areas, the likelihood of contrail formation is assessed. Trailing behind the
aircraft engine exhaust is a plume with a cross section that increases by distance to the aircraft. Inside
the plume, the water vapor emissions are diluted, while the temperature decreases due to mixing with
the outer atmosphere. Because flight corridors might be fairly busy, it is also checked whether local
relative humidity (at the aircraft position) is increased by the plumes of aircraft flying nearby. If this
happens, the preceding aircraft engine emissions concentrations are added to the local atmospheric
conditions.
The prediction of persistence of contrails is based on the Schmidt–Appleman criterion, adapted by
Schumann [4], which translates the engine partial conversion of combustion heat into kinetic energy and
resulting higher temperatures in the aircraft plume. The formation of contrails is then predicted by the
dilution process in the plume and the local atmospheric conditions, including relative humidity, local

temperature, freezing and dew point temperatures. This criterion predicts whether a contrail will form
and, if formed, will be persistent or short-lived. Subsequently, the candidate trajectories are scored and
this information is forwarded to the next modules. This is schematically depicted in Figure 2.
Figure 2: CREATE-SOL-3 ESM concept schematic
In the Decision Making and Pareto Frond Analysis (DMPA) module of CREATE-SOL-2 the ESM score
is used as input for the decision making to select the most optimal trajectory, taking into account
environmental and capacity conditions and constraints.
3.2. Scoring rationale
In terms of non-CO emissions, the ESM considers NO , H O and contrail formation. Figure 3 illustrates
2 x 2
how the ESM score is built-up. The following considerations apply:
• CO : Since CO climate impact is not depending on location or altitude, the performance of a
2 2
CT in terms of CO emissions is scored based on total emitted CO and compared to other CTs;
2 2
• NO and H O: The climate impact of NO and H O emissions depends on the location,
x 2 x 2
geographically and with respect to altitude, and time of emission, and the background
concentrations present. This however, is subject to many uncertainties. It is known that the
impact of these emissions increases with emission altitude [2][3]. Therefore, the impact of these
emissions is related to emission altitude which can be easily obtained from the trajectory data.
Emissions are assessed per flight segment and heavier weights are assigned to emissions at
higher altitudes than average cruise altitudes, and lower weights are assigned to emissions at
lower altitudes. For this assessment altitude bands, expressed in terms of atmospheric pressure,
have been defined and weights are assigned to each altitude band, see Table 1. The weights are
used to multiply the emissions per altitude band, which is then further used in the EMS score
build-up (see Figure 3). At the current stage of the research, i.e. TRL1, it was decided to assign
the weights per altitude/pressure band based on expert judgement. For higher TRL research it
should be researched if this approach is sufficient for an aircraft trajectory environmental
scoring metric.

The current scope considers Contrail Formation Region (CFR) to be relevant for the definition of CSAs,
however the solution is sufficiently generic to include other meteorological phenomena as well in future
developments of the ESM for use in the ATM solution selection and optimization. The ESM score is
designed in such a way that the contrail formation likelihood is key to the score.
Figure 3: CREATE-SOL-3 ESM score build-up
3.3. ESM equation
The ESM scoring algorithm combines the CO , NOx, water vapor and contrail formation scores into a
2
single environmental ESM score. Note that NOx emissions are relatively small to CO and H2O
2
emissions and in turn much larger than the contrail score that is expressed in a range from 0 to 1. For
the purpose of comparison of alternative candidate trajectories for a single flight, the scores are
normalized to the reference flight, candidate 0 (c0). The impact of CO , NOx and water vapor could be
2
assessed using climate specific metrics like Average Temperature Response (ATR) for different time
horizons, such metrics are computationally intensive and therefore not yet applicable for (tactical) ATM
flight planning. For the purpose of this study, a simple equal weighting is assumed for the CO , NOx
2
and water vapor. The ESM is designed to emphasize contrail formation in climate sensitive areas and
dominates the score if the likelihood is larger than 50%. The overall ESM score is then defined by
Equation (1).
( 𝐶𝑂 2𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 + 𝑁𝑂 𝑥𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒, + 𝐻 2 𝑂 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 ) (1)
𝐶𝑂 𝑁𝑂 𝐻 𝑂
2𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒,𝑐0 𝑥𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒,𝑐0 2 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒,𝑐0
𝐸𝑆𝑀 = +2∗𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑙_𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒
3
Note the contrail score is in many cases not a property of a single flight candidate; the formation of
contrail likelihood instead depends on the vicinity of neighbouring candidate trajectory by other flights.
An ESM score is then always depending on one or more related candidate flights.

4. Fast-Time Simulation Exercise
An illustrative example focusing on the North Atlantic air space extending into the European Civil
Aviation Conference (ECAC) area is shown in this section. The geographical domain and corresponding
weather and traffic sample was based on the historical data of 27-07-2018. For this specific day, Europe
experienced a high weather-induced delays, as shown in the EUROCONTROL DDR2 data, with
considerable thunderstorms and contrail areas present over the North Atlantic area. Figure 4 provides
an overview of the computational domain including the Climate Sensitive Areas (CSA), related to
contrail formation; and No Fly Zones (NFZ), related to thunderstorm formation). The following
considerations should be taken for this use-case: contrail formation near Greenland; thunderstorm
occurrences near central US and EU; and altitudes: FL285-FL420 (28,500ft to 42,000ft).
Figure 4: En-route use-case overview from the NEST tool, mapped on the North Atlantic region and Central Europe, based
on 27-07-2018 historical data. Blue areas are CSAs, green areas are clear air turbulence, red areas are thunderstorm NFZs.
The flight patterns are derived from EUROCONTROL DDR2 flight plan database. The CSAs and NFZs were acquired from
the TCP module of the CREATE-SOL-2 framework.
In order to address the trade-off between environmental impact and cost for the AUs, two objective
functions are considered in this illustrative example: the environmental contribution of the flights (𝐶𝐸);
𝑘
and extra cost for the AU (𝐶𝐴𝑈), accounting for the extra fuel cost and delay induced by the avoidance
𝑘
trajectory if compared with the nominal flight plan. Then a compound objective function J is built by
simply weighting these two objectives.
(2)
𝐽 = ∑[𝛼𝐶𝐸 +(1−𝛼)𝐶𝐴𝑈]
𝑘 𝑘
𝑘∈𝐾
where 𝛼 is the weighting parameter (ranging from 0 to 1 and 𝑘 is a trajectory within the set of trajectories
𝐾 for a specific flight. 𝐶𝐸and 𝐶𝐴𝑈, in turn, are defined as follows:
𝑘 𝑘
𝐶𝐸 = 𝑤 ⋅𝐸 ⋅𝑧 , ∀𝑘 ∈𝐾 (3)
𝑘 𝑒 𝑘 𝑘
𝐶𝐴𝑈 =𝑤 ·𝐶𝐹 ⋅𝑧 +𝑤 ⋅𝐷 , ∀𝑘 ∈𝐾 (4)
𝑘 𝑐 𝑘 𝑘 𝑑 𝑘
where 𝑤 , 𝑤 and 𝑤 are the weighted costs of the ESM, displacement cost and delay, respectively.
𝑒 𝑐 𝑑
Currently, these weighted values are used to normalise the input data, so the sum is fair in terms of units.
𝐷 is the delay allocated to candidate trajectory 𝑘 when it crosses the first encountered sector.
𝑘
5. Results
The output of the simulations results in a Pareto front, which is shown in Figure 5. For different relative
weights between (𝛼 values), the mean ESM per flight is plotted versus the mean extra cost per flight
(Figure 5a). The latter is related to the airline operating cost, which involves both fuel consumption and
extra flight time/delay elements. The decision variable 𝛼 is used to select a solution on the Pareto front.

● Higher 𝛼:
o Lower ESM score, leading to “greener” flight solutions.
o Higher extra operating cost per flight.
● Lower 𝛼:
o Lower extra operating cost, leading to cost-effective solutions.
o Higher ESM score, leading to higher-environmental-impact solutions.
a) Extra cost for the Airspace Users vs. ESM b) Delay vs. ESM
Figure 5: Pareto front analysis for the North-Atlantic case study (27-07-2018). The results show only one iteration of the
tactical trajectory replanning (30min of flight).
The decision can also be based on the mean delay assigned per flight. Figure 5Figure 5b represents the
whole network delay vs. the network environmental score. As aforementioned, for higher 𝛼 values,
“greener” flights solutions are obtained, which will generally lead to trajectories avoiding contrail areas.
These “greener” solutions will stretch the flight trajectory paths, generally resulting in a higher global
delay. In the “greenest” case, a global delay of 17 seconds is obtained. On the other hand, while
exploring lower alphas (close to 0.0), the delay drops to 11 seconds.
Bear in mind that in this scenario no-go areas were included, forcing some “candidate zero” flights to
be unfeasible. For these initial flights crossing, for instance, thunderstorms, the only solution was to
divert laterally. Thus, leading to an offset into the global network delay and the total extra cost.
It should also be noted that the results shown above correspond to only one iteration of the tactical
trajectory replanning algorithm, corresponding to 30 minutes of flight for this particular example. The
CREATE-SOL-2 concept involves consecutive iterations of the algorithm to continuously adapt the
trajectories every time a new weather update is received. Hence, the values of ESM and extra cost or
delay shown above are those that are incurred in those 30 minutes of flight of this first iteration of the
avoidance trajectory (hence the relatively low values).
6. Discussion and Recommendations
The objective of the CREATE-SOL-3 (ESM) was to develop a pragmatic metric which could be easily
used in tactical trajectory optimisation. The ESM relied on scoring various candidate trajectories to
select the most suitable option in the trajectory selection process of the ATC DST. The scoring
weights and scoring equation however are still open for debate with a wider range of stakeholders to
ensure that a “fair” evaluation is done of the CO and non-CO effects. Currently, the ESM scoring was
2 2
done based on internal expert judgement which is in line with the TRL1 maturity of the solution. Yet,
it would be recommended for future research to involve as well e.g., Air Navigation Service Providers
(ANSP), airlines, and regulators to discuss the applicability and scoring of the ESM on a higher
practical level.

In the en-route case experiment, many alternative trajectories per flight were generated. The number of
candidate trajectories escalated quickly with the number of areas crossed by the baseline trajectories,
due to the fact that there were many strategies that could be chosen to avoid these areas (e.g., divert to
the left or right, avoid vertically, etc). The more areas to be avoided, the higher the possible
combinations to avoid these areas, and the more alternative trajectories generated.
Having a higher number of trajectories led to higher computational times for the ESM module; that is
one of the reasons why the number of alternative trajectories was limited to 11 in the en-route
experiment. Furthermore, many trajectories were not operationally feasible, and many of them were
filtered out. However, both the limitation in the number of trajectories and the filtering were done in
quite a manual way. In the future, a more “intelligent” system would be needed to limit this number of
trajectories. Moreover, assuming the computational times for the ESM will be lower, more trajectories
could be generated for each flight, potentially leading to better results.
7. Conclusions
The solution presented in this paper is able to provide an initial quantification of the “greenness” of
aircraft trajectories, combining both the CO and non-CO effects into a single metric. Because of the
2 2
simplicity of the metric (the ESM outputs a single value per trajectory), it can be well used for
trajectory optimisation and tactical replanning, as well as flight and ATC sector environmental
performance evaluations (e.g., in performance dashboards for airlines and air navigation service
providers). The implementation could be universally applied to flight trajectories, given the required
meteorological information is present to perform the calculations. The current implementation is
specifically addressing contrail formation, however future research could expand on other non-CO
2
phenomena. The current implementation should be further optimised for computational speed in a next
research phase.
Within the scope of CREATE it was not decided for which ESM a trajectory is “green”, however it
did provide insights in how an ESM or similar environmental impact metric could be used the ranking
of candidate trajectories in the ATM focused decision-making process. In general, it could be stated
that based on the current mechanism of the CREATE-SOL-3 a greener trajectory has a lower ESM
compared to a reference flight. The Pareto front analysis shows that trade-offs should be made
between green flights and operating cost. As such, it could be used in practice that a given ESM
threshold exists which decreases the selection space for the most cost-effective solution in the DMPA
module.
