## Chapter 1: Seconds from Failure

### Introduction: A Personal Journey Into Understanding the Cracks

Stand back—I have a GPU and I’m not afraid to use it.

That’s how it began: with irreverent conviction and a question I couldn’t shake.

What if we could simulate failure? Not to prevent it immediately, but to *understand* it. What if we could generate the kinds of systemic unravelings that take lives in the real world—like aircraft crashes—not to sensationalize them, but to deeply explore the hidden cracks in complex systems?

I grew up watching *Seconds from Disaster*. Despite its tabloid name, it’s a surprisingly thoughtful show that picks apart plane crashes and infrastructure failures by retracing the domino trail of small mistakes, miscommunications, and missing safeguards. The ultimate message? No one act causes catastrophe. It’s the *system* that fails—across agents, sensors, procedures, expectations, and timing.

This idea stuck with me: we never get to hear from the people who didn’t survive these failures. We don’t know what the pilot *thought* the system was telling them. We don’t know what the controller *believed* was happening. We just have the black box—and maybe some simulator recreations with surviving pilots who face other pressures, like memory and social perception.

But what if we could do better?

What if we used reinforcement learning agents—ML-Agents—to simulate these actors in the system? We can train them to fly, to decide, to react. And more importantly: to fail. They don’t get tired. They don’t flinch. They can explore 10,000 disastrous scenarios while we sleep.

Then came the second part of the idea: we pair that agent with a large language model—not to control it, but to *watch*. To observe, interpret, and narrate. To learn, in parallel, how the ML-Agent is solving the task, how it adapts under pressure, and where its learned strategies reveal dangerous blind spots.

It’s not about explainable AI in the traditional sense. It’s about building a cognitive layer *over* simulation. A narrator, a detective, a theorist. An LLM trained on flight logs, reward curves, trajectories, near misses—and asked to tell us what it thinks the agent was trying to do. Where its strategy went brittle. Where it ignored a signal. Where it *misunderstood* the situation.

The ultimate goal? To create a meta-system that helps us understand not only how agents fail, but *why*. And maybe—just maybe—spot those same patterns in human systems, too.

This isn’t just a simulator. It’s a research testbed. A story generator. A second black box—this time with *words*.

This is Some Bananas.
Welcome to the wreckage.

**HOST 1:** Alright, so picture this: we train a bunch of ML-Agents to fly simulated drones or aircraft. They’ve got limited perception, some noisy data, and a mission—say, navigate from point A to point B without crashing into each other.

**HOST 2:** Okay, standard multi-agent RL setup. What’s new?

**HOST 1:** We *want* them to fail.

**HOST 2:** (laughs) That’s the goal?

**HOST 1:** Yep. I grew up watching *Seconds from Disaster*. It always struck me—these disasters aren’t caused by one mistake. They’re cascades. A tiny defect here, a miscommunication there... boom. So I thought: let’s simulate that. Let’s recreate those brittle chains.

**HOST 2:** Interesting. But how do you study *why* the agents failed? Especially with neural nets—it’s not like they leave diary entries.

**HOST 1:** That’s the kicker. We introduce an LLM. Not to control the agents, but to *observe them*. To learn, over time, how the agents behave, what their internal logic might be. And then try to explain it—in language.

**HOST 2:** Like a narrator. Or a cognitive profiler.

**HOST 1:** Exactly. Think of it as pairing a pilot with a psychologist who’s trained on every log, every crash, every weird success. The LLM sees 10,000 runs and starts saying things like, “This agent seems to prioritize proximity over path length,” or “It ignored a warning because that sensor was noisy in earlier runs.”

**HOST 2:** So you get both behavior *and* interpretation. That’s powerful.

**HOST 1:** And potentially actionable. If we can find the signature of a failing strategy *before* the crash—because the LLM spotted it—that’s huge.

**HOST 2:** This isn’t just bananas. This is... Some Bananas.

**HOST 1:** (laughing) Damn right it is.
