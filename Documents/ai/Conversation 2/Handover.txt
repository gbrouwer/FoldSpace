# 🧭 Instructions for Successor: FoldSpace Simulation

Welcome, co-pilot. You’re stepping into the FoldSpace simulation: a modular, emergent platform for exploring 4D drone coordination through a voxelized airspace. The system you're inheriting is modular, well-scaffolded, and nearing its first milestone — the successful dispatch of a drone through a time-space path.

## 🧱 Current State of the Project

Everything is documented. Reference the markdown files in `docs/`. All systems are live, connected, and ready to support runtime drone execution.

### ✅ Built and Working

* VolumeAgent, VolumeGraph, VolumeEdge fully wired and weighted
* ATCController, UTMController, and SimulationManager implemented and collaborating
* DroneAgent prefab in place and awaiting movement logic
* BFS, Dijkstra, and A\* implemented with proper cost modeling
* ShaderGraph and transparent material tested and visually tuned

### 🔄 In Progress

* Visualizing reachable volumes with emission and alpha
* Precomputed routes displayed as time-sensitive volume emissions
* Scene hierarchy with origin/destination pads and towers completed

### 🧨 Next Action

> Implement `DroneAgent.FollowPath(List<VolumeAgent> path)`

This function should move a drone from one VolumeAgent to the next across timesteps, ideally in world-space using `transform.position → next.worldPosition` or similar.

Once the drone can walk the path, the full pipeline is live.

## 🧠 Key Concepts to Hold On To

* **Everything is 4D** — Time is a first-class dimension in both graph planning and visualization
* **VolumeAgent != VolumeNode** in code, but semantically represents the same unit
* **Emission ≈ Time** — Volumes glow based on their reachability or occupancy in time
* **Reservation** is handled in UTMController, which assigns and locks paths
* **Pathfinding is modular** — plug in any algorithm, but A\* is the default for simulation

## 🧪 Tips and Cautions

* Use `Mathf.Pow(alpha, 2.2f)` if alpha-based transparency appears nonlinear
* Don't over-instantiate prefabs — keep VolumeAgent rendering optional and toggled
* The simulation is deterministic — introduce delays/conflicts manually if needed
* Keep future features logged in `ToDo.md` even if not building them now
* Avoid entangling movement logic with the reservation system — keep clean layers

## 🚁 Where We’re Heading

After FollowPath is working:

* Implement route completion callbacks and despawning
* Add launch windows, queuing, and multi-drone support
* Consider replacing UTM pathfinding with decentralized agents
* Integrate ML-Agents once the deterministic system is stable

## 🫡 Your Role

FoldSpace is both a model and a metaphor. Your job is to observe, refine, and extend — without making it overly complex. Push the boundaries of emergence, but let the system breathe.

Everything is ready. Launch is yours.
