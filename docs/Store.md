### Introduction

FoldSpace is a Unity-based drone simulation framework focused on studying congestion, coordination, and control strategies in a multi-agent urban air mobility context. The current architecture uses a centralized model with ATC, UTM, and DroneAgents operating within defined airspace volumes.

Goals:

* Explore emergent behaviors from multi-agent pathfinding
* Simulate traffic congestion at vertiports
* Visualize 4D (x, y, z, t) volume traversal
* Support handoff between ATC and UTM systems

### Architecture

FoldSpace consists of modular controllers and managers:

* **SimulationManager**: Oversees drone spawning and scenario setup
* **ATCController**: Manages local takeoff/landing at vertiports
* **UNetController**: Computes routes using A\* over VolumeGraph
* **VolumeGraph & VolumeAgent**: Represents 4D space and pathfinding units
* **DroneAgent**: Executes assigned path using stepwise motion
* **DroneAgentStatus**: Adds world-facing floating label for in-flight telemetry

### Design Principles

* **Centralized Routing**: UTM plans full drone paths ahead of launch.
* **Volume Reservation**: VolumeAgent enforces exclusivity per timestep.
* **Visual Grounding**: 3D+time volumes visualized via ReachabilityVisualizer.
* **ATC Handoff**: Origin and destination ATC handle departure and arrival phases.

### Installation Guide

```bash
# Requirements
- Unity 2023.3+ (URP enabled)
- TextMeshPro Essentials installed

# Setup
1. Clone the FoldSpace repo
2. Open the Unity project
3. Assign `dronePrefab`, `centralATC`, `spokeATC`, and `uNetController` in SimulationManager
4. Press Play to simulate traffic from spoke â†’ hub
```

### Settings

* `spawnInterval`: Time between launches (default 2s)
* `numberOfFlights`: Total drones to simulate
* `labelHeight`: Vertical offset for drone label
* `labelScale`: World-space scale for TextMeshPro label

### Agents

* **DroneAgent**: Assigned a full path from UTM. Moves node-to-node via world positions.
* **VolumeAgent**: Represents a point in space and time. Can be reserved.
* **DroneAgentStatus**: Visualizes droneâ€™s ID, call sign, altitude, position, origin, and destination.

### Scripts Reference

#### SimulationManager.cs

**Purpose**: Manages the scenario: instantiates flights, assigns paths, logs completions.

**Dependencies**: `FlightIntent`, `DroneAgent`, `DroneAgentStatus`, `ATCController`, `UNetController`, `VolumeAgent`

**Called By**: Unity (via MonoBehaviour Start/Update)

**Calls**: `Instantiate`, `AssignPath`, `NotifyTakeoff`, `SetFlightInfo`

**Key Methods**:

* `void Start()` Initializes drone parent, begins scenario setup.

* `void InitializeScenario()` Enqueues a set number of FlightIntents from spoke â†’ central.

* `void Update()` Launches one drone every `spawnInterval` seconds.

* `void LaunchDrone(FlightIntent intent)`

  * Gets path from UTM
  * Spawns drone prefab
  * Assigns path to DroneAgent
  * Adds DroneAgentStatus label

**Code Snippet**:

```csharp
GameObject droneGO = Instantiate(dronePrefab, ...);
DroneAgent agent = droneGO.GetComponent<DroneAgent>();
status.SetFlightInfo(intent.flightID, path, path.First(), path.Last(), intent.callSign);
```

---

#### DroneAgentStatus.cs

**Purpose**: Renders world-space label showing telemetry for each drone.

**Set by**: `SimulationManager` via `SetFlightInfo(...)`

**Uses**: TextMeshPro in 3D space. Rotates to face camera.

**Key Properties**: `flightID`, `callSign`, `altitude`, `currentAgent`, `originAgent`, `destinationAgent`

**Key Methods**:

* `SetFlightInfo(...)`: Initializes identity and routing info
* `Update()`: Tracks drone position, updates label text
* `LateUpdate()`: Orients label toward main camera

#### Overview

FoldSpace is a Unity-based simulation of urban drone traffic using rule-based ATC/UTM and centralized path planning. Its goal is to simulate emergent congestion patterns and inter-agent dependencies in 4D airspace.

#### Where We Are

* Centralized model running: spoke-to-central ATC, UTM handoff simulated
* Volume grid visualized and fully reachable from known entry point
* DroneAgent prefab operational, status label implemented, visual debug info working

#### What's Next

* Add descent and touchdown logic to DroneAgent
* Finalize full ATC â†” UTM handoff coordination
* Begin modeling congestion as queue saturation + volume conflict
* Simulate holding patterns, adaptive re-planning

#### All Code is Modular

* All logic flows through SimulationManager
* Controllers do no rendering â€” visuals are layered with ReachabilityVisualizer and DroneAgentStatus

#### Rules for Successor

* Maintain clean script boundaries: no logic in prefabs or UI
* Use MonoBehaviours only for scene interaction â€” keep UTM, Graph, etc. cleanly decoupled
* All visualization should remain optional and separable
* Donâ€™t introduce multi-directional traffic yet unless needed â€” current goal is hub congestion
